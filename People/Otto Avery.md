# Otto Avery

*__Otto Avery__* was a one-time member of Coil, officially joining the band in 1988 and leaving at a later, unspecified point some time after the release of [[Loveâ€™s Secret Domain]] in 1991. No specific credit was given to him on any Coil release, with him only being credited as a member of the band. In interviews at the time, [[Jhonn Balance]] referred to him helping with the sequencing of [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)|Gold is the Metal]] and providing guitar parts and live vocal effects during recording, though which, if any, released songs these were used on is not known.[^1]
