# Threshold Archives

![[Threshold Archives - Logo.jpeg|200]]  
*__Threshold Archives__* is a project started by [[Peter Christopherson]] in 2006 to ensure the preservation of Coil releases which had gone out of print since their release. After Christopherson’s death in 2010, Coil associate Jon Whitney took over the project, announcing it in 2013.[^1]

Upon its initial announcement a number of releases were said to already be in progress:

- [[Scatology]] 4-CD box-set with demos and the albums [[Transparent]] and [[The Angelic Conversation]]
- [[Horse Rotorvator]] 4-CD box-set with [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]] and unused songs from both albums
- [[Love’s Secret Domain]] 4-CD box-set with [[Stolen and Contaminated Songs]] and unused songs from both albums
- A compilation of [[Worship The Glitch]], [[A Thousand Lights In A Darkened Room]] and [[Time Machines]] with a collection of ‘oddities’ from 1995–1998
- *The New Orleans Backwards* 4-CD box-set with demos from the #Backwards session, [[The Ape of Naples]] and [[The New Backwards]]
- *Astral Disaster* 3-CD box-set, including the [[Astral Disaster|LP version]], [[Astral Disaster (CD Version)|CD version]] and unused songs
- *Musick to Play in the Dark* collection, with [[Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 1|MTPID 1]], [[Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 2|MTPID 2]], [[Songs/Queens of the Circulating Library|Queens of the Circulating Library]] and [[Constant Shallowness Leads To Evil]]
- A re-release of [[ANS]]
- A collection of [[Black Antlers]] and [[The Remote Viewer]] alongside unused songs
