The Sound of Musick is a semi-official compilation album by Coil, released on May 15th, 2019 by [[Threshold Archives]].

## Background

*The Sound of Music* was originally the name of an intended compilation of Coil’s soundtrack work. The album was a long-term project, being referred to as far back as 1985[^1] and as recently as 1997,[^2] including allusions within Coil’s music, such as the track *[[The Hills Are Alive]]*. In a 1997 interview, [[Peter Christopherson]] explained that, by that point, all material intended for the record had been released in other formats, with the band having simply chosen not to move ahead with an encompassing collection.[^3]

The *Sound of Music* concept was finally realized in 2019, when [[Threshold Archives]] released an album by this name in their second series of releases.
