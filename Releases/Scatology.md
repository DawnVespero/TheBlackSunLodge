# Scatology

![[Scatology (1984 Vinyl) Cover.jpg|700]]

*__Scatology__* is the debut studio album by Coil, originally released in 1984 by [[Some Bizzare Records]] under the sub-label K.422. Like all Coil releases up to and including [[Horse Rotorvator]], it was attributed to the Coil-specific vanity label [[Force & Form]].

## Recording

Additional recordings from the sessions for the album can be found on the [[Live Coil Archive]]‘s [[Scatology Sessions]] bootleg.

## Release

The album, originally known under the title *__Poisons__*, was initially planned for release under [[Jhonn Balance]]‘s existing label __Hearsay and Heresy__, which had already released the compilation cassette __Bethel__, but instead, it ended up being attributed as the first release of the new Coil-specific vanity label [[Force & Form]].

Two versions of the album are known to have been planned but left unrealized: A ‘skidmark’ color vinyl, and a version with an additional unspecified 7” record from German Label __Record Vox__.[^1]

### Packaging

The cover of the original, LP-only, release features the “Black Sun” icon on plain off-white paper, with the artist and album name at the top. Around the front and back cover are extensive liner notes for each song, as well as the following introductory paragraph:  
%%
The liner notes mentioned in this paragraph should be transcribed on the individual songs’ pages.
%%

> ‘SCATOLOGY’ (n) frequent reference to excretory processes in literature; study of fossil excrement; gross obscenity <br> - extract from the Penguin English Dictionary The Humanism of the Arsehole. “…A psychoanalyst, knowing that gold and excrement are akin in the subconscious, would not have been surprised…that I used my shit - like the hen’s golden eggs, the droppings of the Golden Ass, or Danäe’s divine diarrhea - to perform a phenomenal transmutation through the application of my Paranoia-Critical method.” <br> from “The Unspeakable Confessions of Salvador Dali”, Quartet Books, 1976 <br> The name “Coil”, first used by [[John Balance]] in Autumn 1982 for his solo works, now represents him in collaboration with [[Peter Christopherson]].
  

The final paragraph is only present on the original LP version.

### Versions

- Original release, 1984, LP-only: On the first pressing of this version, all 3000 copies have a postcard stuck over the central logo depicting the framed cover art for the [[Releases/The Anal Staircase|Anal Staircase]] EP. On the second pressing, a random selection of the 2000 copies have a different postcard attached, depicting another photograph referred to as “*Sexual Architecture*”.
- [[Scatology (1988 CD Version)]]: This version is distinguished by ![new cover art] and contains the additional tracks, “*[[Restless Day]]*”, “*Aqua Regis*” and “*Tainted Love*”
- 2001 CD Remaster: First of two remastered albums released in 2001, alongside [[Horse Rotorvator]]. Both albums were remastered by [[Thighpaulsandra]]. These remasters were created due to a dispute over unpaid royalties for the albums Coil released through [[Some Bizzare Records]]. This version features [new cover art], but is otherwise identical in content.
