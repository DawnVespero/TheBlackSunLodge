*__Moon’s Milk in Four Phases (Bonus Disk)__* is an official EP ∕Single by Coil, released in January 2002 by [[Threshold House]]. Originally a bonus for people who ordered [[Moon’s Milk In Four Phases]] directly from Threshold House, an unknown number of copies was later sold separately. An expanded version of this release was published by [[Threshold Archives]] as [[Releases/Copal|Copal]] in 2019.

## Background

Though released with an edition of [[Moon’s Milk In Four Phases]], the songs on the Bonus Disk were not recorded during the sessions for the #SeasonalSingles , having instead been recorded on the Winter Solstice on December 21st, 2001.[^1]

## Release

*This section is currently empty, but is already planned to be filled out in the future. Feel free to leave any suggestions in the lobby!*

### Artwork

The disks came in a plain white card sleeve, each of which had been individually painted by [[Jhonn Balance]].

### Packaging

In addition to the unique cover art, most of the disks were also packaged with a signed Polaroid photo. The back of each sleeve was also numbered and signed by Balance, as well as having one of numerous phrases written on it. A number of these phrases are particularly notable for both referencing previous Coil songs and reappearing in future songs. Despite being numbered, the numbers on the disk sleeves are not unique identifiers, with some known to have been used multiple times, and some copies having no number.
