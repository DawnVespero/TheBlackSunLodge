# Recoiled Special CD

*__Recoiled Extra__* was a limited release added to 26 vinyl copies of *Recoiled* that were sold by [[Danny Hyde]] in 2018. The unlabeled vinyl disks, mistakenly included in the shipment of *Recoiled* LPs Hyde received for resale, were sold with this disc, which contained 4 additional remixes based on those from *Recoiled*. Each pair of record and CD received a unique label / sleeve and was labeled with a letter of the alphabet.

2. [[Closer - Dreamspace Mix (Moody)]]
3. [[The Downward Spiral (Raw Mix)]]
