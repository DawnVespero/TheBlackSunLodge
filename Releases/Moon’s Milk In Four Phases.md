*__Moon’s Milk in Four Phases__* is an official compilation album by Coil, released in 2001 by [[Threshold House]]. It collects the contents of the four “Seasonal Singles” released throughout 1998 — [[Releases/Spring Equinox — Moon’s Milk or Under An Unquiet Skull|Spring Equinox — Moon’s Milk or Under An Unquiet Skull]], [[Summer Solstice — Bee Stings]], [[Autumn Equinox — Amethyst Deceivers]], and [[Winter Solstice]].

## Background

The ‘Seasonal Singles’ were a project recorded by Coil throughout 1997 and released through 1998. For this, they recorded a piece of music on every equinox and solstice of the year, which would be refined and expanded to be released as a single a year after its recording.[^1] Because of this, each single had its corresponding solar and lunar movement imprinted on the disc, which would begin during its recording and end at its release.

## Release

Shortly after the release of *Moon’s Milk*, a limited edition version of the collection was made available which, in addition to the Seasonal Singles, contained a [[Releases/Moon's Milk in Four Phases (Bonus Disk)|Bonus Disk]] with three newly recorded songs.[^2]

In 2006, it was announced that an expanded “Deluxe Version” of the album was being worked on, which would include the original compilation, the [[Moon’s Milk in Four Phases (Bonus Disk)|bonus disc]], and a sixth disc with re-interpretations of songs from the series, along with reproductions of all Bonus Disc covers.[^3] Though this re-release would not happen, the songs recorded for the 6th disc would eventually be released by [[People/Danny Hyde|Danny Hyde]] in 2012 as *Moon’s Milk in Final Phase* under the project *Electric Sewer Age*.[^4]

A second series of #SeasonalSingles was also intended to be released during 2000, but this did not materialize.[^5]

## Versions

- __[[Moon’s Milk in Four Phases (2024 Dais Re-Release)]]__: *Moon’s Milk* was re-released by [[Dais Records]] in 2024. Notably, this version adds the songs found on [[Threshold Archives]]‘ [[Releases/Copal|Copal]].
