*__Gold is the Metal (With the Broadest Shoulders)__* is an official studio album by Coil, released in 1987 by [[Threshold House]]. It collects a number of Coil recordings that had not been featured on any previous release.

## Background

*Gold is the Metal* contains a number of recordings made by Coil that did not end up on an official release. This includes unused recordings from the sessions for *[[Horse Rotorvator]]*, as well as a number of experiments not related to that album,[^1] such as a remix of the 1985 #Compilation_Track “*[[Neither His Nor Yours]]*”.

## Release

The album is notable for being the first release on Coil’s “*[[Threshold House]]*” label, subsequently bearing the catalog number “LOCI 1”.  
As with previous Coil releases, the album was initially only produced as a vinyl LP, with a CD version being released in 1988. A second CD release was published in 1996. This version received new cover art, but was otherwise identical to the previous 1988 CD release.

### Artwork

The original LP artwork for the album is very plain, mostly depicting an orange metallic texture with rust-like patches, overlaid with a number of straight-angled lines. The album title is printed in red cursive font in a blank box in the center of the cover.  
A few variations of this cover art exist:

- A number of copies from the original two pressings had no text printed on them at all. The box on the front of the sleeve that originally contained the album title was apparently left blank on this version, while the box on the back that contained the liner notes was removed completely.[^2]
- The third pressing of the original LP release, published by Normal Records, featured text in blue instead of red[^2]

### Packaging

Like [[Scatology]], the album contains extensive liner notes describing each song. Notably, [[Thump]], [[For Us They Will]] and [[Soundtrap]] are noted as having been recorded “[[Unreleased Projects#*Live At Bar Maldoror*|Live at Bar Maldoror]]”, alluding to the unreleased live video album announced shortly before *Gold is the Metal*,[^3] though no official meaning to this has ever been confirmed.

The limited Deluxe Edition came in a file folder-like package panelled with black wood. Besides the album and single, the box contained three full-color artwork prints, two black-and-white posters, a credits sheet, and a signed certificate of authenticity. Most notably, it contains a booklet featuring a selection of artwork as well as reprints of handwritten lyric notes for both songs on the album and a number of unproduced songs. (A transcription of these notes can be found in Phil Barrington’s book *[The Golden Age of Bloodsports](http://www.barringtonarts.com/GoldenAge_Bloodsports.pdf)*). This booklet also contains Coil’s first use of the phrase “*[[A Thousand Lights In A Darkened Room|Black Light District]]*”.[^4] [^5]

### Versions

- __Original LP release__: Like previous Coil albums, *Gold is the Metal* was initially only released on vinyl record. An unknown number of the first copies were shipped with the “*[[The Wheel ∕ The Wheal ∕ Keelhauler|The Wheel]]*” single on a 7” vinyl record.
	- __Deluxe Edition__: Limited to 55 copies and only available through mail order, this version contains a copy of the album with an attached gold leaf, the *“[[The Wheel ∕ The Wheal ∕ Keelhauler|The Wheel]]”* single, and a number of supplementary writings and artwork. For details, see [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)#Packaging|＃Packaging]].
- __[[Gold is the Metal (CD Version)|1988 CD version]]__: The CD release of the album added the bonus tracks “[[Hellraiser]]” and “[[The Wheal]]”. This version was later re-released in 1996 with new artwork.
