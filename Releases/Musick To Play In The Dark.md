*__Musick To Play In The Dark__* is an official studio album by Coil, released in September 1999 by [[Labels/Chalice|Chalice]]. It is the first in a two-part series, having been followed by [[Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 2]] in 2000.

## Background

Though no liner notes were included with the album, an interview with [[Jhonn Balance]] was intended to replace them. This, however, did not come to fruition, and the interview was instead published on Coil’s Brainwashed site as the *Track-by-Track* feature. [^1]
