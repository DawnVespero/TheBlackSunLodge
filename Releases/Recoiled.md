Recoiled is a semi-official Coil compilation, released on February 24th, 2014 by [[Cold Spring Records]]. It contains a number of [[Danny Hyde]]s recreations of unreleased remixes created during Coil’s remix sessions for Nine Inch Nails.

# Background

After the release of [[Nine Inch Nails]]‘ *Further Down The Spiral* in 1995, which would end up being Coil’s final contribution to a NIN remix album, rumors started to circulate around online NIN fan communities that Coil had created several remixes for these albums that ended up not being used. The NIN fan page nothing.nin.net reported these as part of the “Phantom NIN Songs”: “*Eraser (a version with worms)*”, *”The Downward Spiral (a gilded sickness)”*  “*The Downward Spiral (fullblown)*” and “*Gave Up(remix by coil, used in movie Young Americans, faster than fixed version and uses the same sound template according to John Balance of Coil. fixed version appears on soudtrack)*”.[^1]

In 2012, [[Danny Hyde]] was contacted by a member of the Nine Inch Nails fan forum *Echoing The Sound* asking for unreleased mixes after the former showed a box of tapes from [[Nothing Records]] in a YouTube video. Hyde confirmed that the box shown in the video contained recordings from the sessions for Coil’s NIN remix sessions, and arranged for them to be sent to the forum member. The recordings were transferred from their original DAT tapes and eventually released as the digital-only [[Uncoiled]], which was eventually expanded with commentary by Hyde as [[Uncoiled Extended]]. After [[Cold Spring Records]] expressed interest in releasing the material on physical formats, Hyde curated a new tracklist for the commercial release *Recoiled*.

# Recording

Originally, it was believed that the recordings released by Danny Hyde and featured on *Uncoiled* were as they were made during their respective original recording sessions. As Hyde talked more about the process, however, it became clear that this was a misunderstanding: Due to storage limitations, no other full songs were saved at the time of recording, and the tapes Hyde had shown were, in reality, numerous samples, separate tracks and sub-mixes, which he had assembled only after being contacted about them, though with the help of his documentation from the time.[^2]

During the creation of these mixes, Hyde also created a number of additional mixes which were later released on the [[Recoiled Special CD]].

## Versions

- __[[Uncoiled]]:__ The original, digital-only release of Danny Hyde’s recreated remixes.
- __[[Uncoiled Extended]]:__ Released about a month after the original *Uncoiled*, this version added commentary tracks by Hyde and a ‘mock demo’ of *Closer*. It also fixed a speed issue with one of the tracks.[^3]
- *__Recoiled__* is the commercial release of the recreated tracks, which omits a number of tracks that only had minor differences to each other
