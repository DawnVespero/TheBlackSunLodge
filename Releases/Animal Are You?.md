The release of the *Animal Are You?* box set was conceived as part of Absinthevertrieb Lion’s *Duplais* series of Absinthes, for which artists were commissioned to create unique label art for each brand. A series of 3 different flavors — Verte, Blanche, and Balance — the labels were designed by [[David Tibet]], [[Steven Stapleton]], and [[Peter Christopherson]], respectively.[^1]
