*__How To Destroy Angels__* is the debut single by Coil, released in 1984 by [[LAYLA Antirecords]].

## Background

Originally, the debut single under the Coil name was intended to be [[Silence & Secrecy (section) (live at Magenta Club, London 5.VIII.1983)|Silence&Secrecy]], a song performed at [[1983-08-04: Club Magenta, London, England|Coil’s first concert]] and previously released in excerpt on the live album [[Transparent]]. [[Songs/How to Destroy Angels|How to Destroy Angels]] was originally created to serve as the B-side to this single. However, this single was also intended to be released through Psychic TV’s Temple Records; due to [[Peter Christopherson]] and [[John Balance]] leaving Psychic TV in 1984, the band were presumably no longer willing to release the single.

### Versions

A few different versions of the vinyl single exist, but most changes only affect the form and presentation of the B-side song, [[Absolute Elsewhere]]; see its page for details.  
Notably, the first pressing of the single is said to have been shipped with a black&white poster in A3 size; however, this poster does not appear to have been documented. [^1]
