*__Astral Disaster__* is an official studio album by Coil, released in January 1999 by [[Prescription]].

## Background

*Astral Disaster*’s original release was a very quickly made project, produced for a single small production run on the short-lived Prescription label, whose releases were each limited to 99 copies on vinyl records. However, by the end of recording, plans were already in place to further develop this material for a full commercial release.[^1] This [[Releases/Astral Disaster (CD Version)|expanded version]] would eventually be issued on both vinyl record and CD through [[Labels/Threshold House|Threshold House]] in 2000.

## Recording

Recording of the album took place over two days on Samhain 1998 (a.k.a. October 31st and November 1st). The album was recorded in Gary Ramon’s Sun Dial Studios, located in an old underground debtors’ prison in Southwark, London.
