*__Time Machines__* is an official studio album by Coil (under the alias [[Coil#Time Machines|Time Machines]], released in January 1998 by [[Threshold House]].

## Background

*Time Machines* consists of four minimalist drone pieces, which are intended to distort a listener’s perception of time. The titles of these pieces — each named after the chemical formula and common name of a psychoactive drug — were chosen for the similarity of the drug’s effects to those of the recording.[^1]

## Artwork

The album’s cover artwork — a black oval on a plain cardboard background — was inspired by the occult practices of 17th-century astronomer [[People/John Dee|John Dee]], who was said to have used a black obsidian mirror for scrying rituals.[^2][^1] Dee is further referenced by the symbols contained in the interior packaging: The colored icons representing each track are the components of Dee’s *Monas Hieroglyphica*, a compound symbol with numerous mystical and astrological meanings.[^3] A version of the full monad is also used in the artwork.

## Release

In the immediate aftermath of *Time Machines*’ release, [[People/Jhonn Balance|Jhonn Balance]] discussed plans to release a 5-CD box set as the next work from the *Time Machines* project. He would also talk about ideas for similar long-form performances, such as a continuous one-week performance styled as a walk-in art exhibit.[^2] However, none of these ideas would come to fruition, and no further release would be made under the *Time Machines* name.

## Tracklist

1. [[7-Methoxy-β-Carboline- (Telepathine)]]
2. [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Ethyl-Amphetamine- (DOETHecate)]]
3. [[5-Methoxy-N, N-Dimethyl- (5-Me0-DMT)]]
