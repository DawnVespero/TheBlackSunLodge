*__The Unreleased Themes For Hellraiser__* is an official soundtrack album by Coil, released in 1987 by Solar Lodge Records.

## Background

According to [[Stephen Thrower]], Barker became involved with Coil some time in 1985, around the recording of [[Scatology]]. This led to Barker being in contact with the group even before the publication of his novella *The Hellbound Heart*, which he would eventually adapt into the film *Hellraiser*. Thrower also claims that during this time, Barker took a great interest in [[Peter Christopherson]]‘s collection of BDSM magazines, reflecting themes that would later appear in Hellraiser.

Due to their personal connection, Barker intended for Coil to score the film adaptation of *The Hellbound Heart* from the project’s inception. However, the group could only complete some preliminary synth-based drafts before the film’s producer decided to contract composer Christopher Young for the score. Thrower claims the films producers had been intent on having Young work on the film from the beginning, and negotiations on the special effects budget eventually forced Barker to concede to their demand.[^1]

## Recording

Due to the relatively short and incomplete sessions for the score, the music that ended up seeing a commercial release as *The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser* did not represent the intended form of these pieces: it had been planned to augment the electronic pieces with orchestrated elements, similar to what would be seen on [[Horse Rotorvator]].[^1]

## Release

Some time in 1986, John Sanders and Mick Gaffney, who were already associated with Coil, asked the band to create a single-issue magazine discussing their musical output and artistic interests, to be published under their art collective *R&D Group 28*. The magazine, known variously as *A Coil Magazine*[^2] or *Hang Loose With Coil*[^3] and released in 1987, ended up being highly successful; the initial pressing of 500 copies sold out within a month, and the total print run ended up amounting to three printings at a total of 1500 copies. In response to this, *R&D Group 28* asked for and acquired the permission to publish some of Coil’s music.

First mentioned in the *Coil Info Booklet ＃2* in September 1987, the release of the unfinished *Hellraiser* score was originally intended as part of the score compilation [[The Sound Of Musick]], with a separate release on 7” vinyl record for the music written by Coil for commercials that [[Peter Christopherson]] had been involved with.[^4]

The final release ended up merging these two projects: The initial *R&D Group 28* release was published as a 10” vinyl record, with one side being taken up by selections from the *Hellraiser* score, and the other consisting of the aforementioned commercial tracks.

Additional tracks from the scoring sessions were later released on the compilation [[Unnatural History Ⅱ|Unnatural History II]].

An [[The Consequences of Raising Hell (T-ARCH)|expanded version]] of this released was published by [[Threshold Archives]] in 2015.

### Versions

- __Original 1988 Release__: The original release was a 10” vinyl record released through *R&D Group 28*. The cover features artwork from Trevor Brown, who also provided artwork for *A Coil Magazine*. Three variants of this release exist:

	- Black vinyl, unknown amount [^6]
	- Pink vinyl, 500 copies [^7]
- __US Cassette Release__: At the same time as the UK vinyl release, a version on cassette was released only in the United States by Soleilmoon. The cover features different artwork also created by Trevor Brown.
- __[[Hellraiser Themes]]__: In 1990, the score was re-released by [[Torso]] in a notably different version: This release excised the *Music for Commercials* tracks, but added three new tracks from the *Hellraiser* score sessions.[^8]
- __[[The Consequences of Raising Hell (T-ARCH)|Threshold Archives release:]]__  In 2015, [[Threshold Archives]] released an expanded version which contained all previously released *Hellraiser* score pieces, *Music for Commercials*, and a number of unreleased demos.
