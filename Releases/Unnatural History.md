**_Unnatural History (Compilation Tracks Compiled)_** is an official compilation album by Coil, released in 1990 by [[Threshold House]]. It collects a number of tracks Coil contributed to compilation albums that did not appear on any of their official releases. The album would see two continuations, [[Unnatural History Ⅱ|Unnatural History II]] in 1995, and [[Unnatural History Ⅲ|Unnatural History III]] in 1997.

## Background
The origin of the tracks is as follows:

| Track Title | Release Title | Label | Release Year |
| :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **[[S Is For Sleep]]** | *The Elephant Table Album* | X Tract | 1983 |
| **[[Homage to Sewage]]** | *Life At The Top* | Third Mind Records | 1984 |
| **[[How To Destroy Angels (Mono)\|How To Destroy Angels]]** | *[[Releases/How To Destroy Angels\|How To Destroy Angels]]* | [[L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords]] | " |
| **[[Various Hands]], [[The Swelling of Leeches]], [[The Pope Held Upside Down]]** | [[Nightmare Culture]] | [[L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords]] | 1985 |
| **[[Here To Here (Double-Headed Secret)]]** | *The Beast 666* | Nekrophile Records | " |
| **[[Sicktone]]** | *The Fight Is On* | [[L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords]] | " |
| **[[His Body Was a Playground For the Nazi Elite]]** | *Ohrensausen* | Dom | 1986 |
| **[[Dream Photography]]** | *Peyrere* | Peyrere | " |
| **[[Never]]** | *Less Than Angels* | Synapse | " |


In addition to previously released tracks, *Unnatural History I* also contained two new songs: [[Comfortable]] and [[Penetralia II]]. In spite of this, the liner notes for the album declare previous releases for these. [[Comfortable]] is said to have been released on a cassette album called *Raw Like Sewage* on the label *Premonition*, and [[Penetralia II]] on a dedicated 7” vinyl single on the label *Shock 45*; neither of these releases is known to exist.

For unknown reasons, and unlike all other tracks on the album, [[Songs/How to Destroy Angels|How to Destroy Angels]] is presented as monophonic.

### Versions
The album was only released in one version, a CD release in 1990, which was repressed in 1999.[^2]
