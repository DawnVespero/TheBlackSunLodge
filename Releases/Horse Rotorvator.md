*__Horse Rotorvator__* is the second studio album by Coil, originally released in 1986 by [[Some Bizzare Records]] under the sub-label K.422. Like all preceding Coil releases, it was attributed to the Coil-specific vanity label [[Force & Form]], being the last release on the label.

## Background

The title of the album was inspired by a dream of [[Jhonn Balance]]‘s,[^1] which is recounted on the original album’s cover:

> On the eve of the Apocalypse — (the air choked with horsehair) — The Four Horsemen betray their steeds — cutting the animals’ throats — and in doing so release the Second Great Deluge — Horsegore — infinite divisibles split — an infinity of open sewers —  
> The Four then fashion an immense earthmoving device from the collective jawbones — The Horse Rotorvator — with which to plow up the waiting world — (ROTA turns through 180° to TARO) — wheels replace horses — dark horses run deep — and hell is paved with horseflesh … (We plow the fields and scatter our dead steeds on the land) [^2]

## Release

The release of the album was preceded by the single [[Releases/The Anal Staircase|The Anal Staircase]].

### Artwork

The cover art of the original LP release of the album features a photograph of the bandstand at London’s [Hyde Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London). The location was likely chosen due to it having been the site of[an IRA attack in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park_and_Regent%27s_Park_bombings) which killed, among others, seven bandsmen and seven horses. The location would also later be referenced through the track ‘[[Hydlepark]]’ on the 1995 album [[Worship The Glitch]].

The later 1988 CD release features a fisheye lens photograph of the sculpture *[Physical Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Energy_(sculpture)#Casts)* by George Frederic Watts, located in London’s Kensington Gardens.

A test pressing is also known to exist which uses artwork by Trevor Brown, also used on the contemporaneous *A Coil Magazine*.[^3]

### Packaging

Unlike the preceding album, [[Scatology]], *Horse Rotorvator* did not contain any explanatory liner notes, with the 1988 CD release only receiving liner notes with lyrics.

### Versions

- __1986 Promo cassette__: A promotional cassette released in 1986 uses the working titles for two tracks: *“Baby Lero”* for [[Babylero]], and *“Acapulco March”* for [[Herald]]. In addition, the song listed as [[Songs/The Anal Staircase|The Anal Staircase]] is actually [[The Anal Staircase (Relentless Mix)]], suggesting the latter was the originally intended album mix.[^4]
- __Original 1987 LP release__: Like the preceding album, [[Scatology]], *Horse Rotorvator* did not initially receive a CD release, only being distributed on vinyl record and tape.
- __[[Horse Rotorvator (US Cassette Release)|U.S. cassette release]]__: This version, distributed by Relativity Records, adds the tracks [[Ravenous]] and [[The Anal Staircase (A Dionysian Remix)]] from the [[Releases/The Anal Staircase|The Anal Staircase]] single to the track list, though they are not listed in the packaging. It also uses the working titles seen on the 1986 promo cassette, in addition to the title *“Silk”* for [[Slur]]. [^5]
- __[[Horse Rotorvator (1988 CD Version)|1988 CD release]]__: Like the U.S. cassette release, the 1988 cassette release added [[Ravenous]] to the track list. Unlike the former though, it did not add [[The Anal Staircase (A Dionysian Remix)]].
