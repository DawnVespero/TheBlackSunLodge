The *__Coil Manifesto__* is a text written by John Balance in 1983 as a mission statement for the Coil project. Although it has, over time, become one of Balanceâ€™s most famous prose pieces, a definitive version of the text was not published until 2001 in spoken form and 2009 in written form. Before this time, the Manifesto was only ever published in numerous excerpts as part of interviews with the band.
