# Unreleased Projects

Over the span of their career, Coil announced a number of projects that would not see release:

## *Force And Form*

An album mentioned as being in production towards the end of work on *[[Scatology]]*. It is not known if this evolved into some other project, and it was only mentioned once. [^1]

## *Live At Bar Maldoror*

Originally announced in 1985,[^2] *Live at Bar Maldoror* was intended to be a live video album. It was intended to be the third in a series of eponymous 1985 albums by *[[Steven Stapleton|Nurse With Wound]]* and [[People/David Tibet|[Current 93]]].[^3] According to [[Jhonn Balance]], it was largely intended as an expensive “Deluxe” release that would raise money for the band.[^4] It was mentioned again in the *Coil Info Booklet ＃2* in 1987 and during interviews in 1991 and 1992, the latter of which described it as having not been started.[^5]

The project was also referenced in the liner notes to *“[[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)|Gold is the Metal]]”*, where [[Thump]], [[For Us They Will]] and [[Soundtrap]] were described as having been “*Recorded live at Bar Maldoror*”. No official explanation for this has ever been given.[^6]

%% The “Bar Maldoror” concept was apparently something jointly invented by John Balance, Steven Stapleton, and David Tibet; the idea being that they would declare whatever venue they were playing at as “Bar Maldoror” to call back to this sort of shared context and atmosphere. There is a page on Discogs for it, (<https://www.discogs.com/de/label/323656-Bar-Maldoror?sort=year&sort_order=asc>) which is where I’m taking this info from, but I haven’t bought the magazine the quote’s from yet. It’s Issue #28 of Audion, if anybody else’s interested, its available here: <https://audion1.bandcamp.com/album/audion-28-multimedia>%%

## *The Gate*

In 1986, plans started for a spiritual follow-up to [[Releases/How To Destroy Angels|How To Destroy Angels]] called *The Gate* which would have a similar ritual purpose. Like *How To Destroy Angels*, the project was meant to be released as a single, but would feature two fully recorded tracks: *The Gate* and a second track to be titled *Forced Entry* or *Point of Entry*. The project was also meant to be a collaboration with Adi Newton of The Anti-Group. Thematically, the songs were intended to have strong references to H.P. Lovecraft, his Cthulhu Mythos, and especially the work of his associate Clarke Ashton Smith, including plans to use a painting of Smith’s for the single’s cover.

Little was ever revealed publicly about the project. Its first mention was in an interview with *AbrAhAdAbrAh* in 1986,[^7] and in 1990, the existence of a collaboration with TAG was confirmed and said to still be in production.[^8]

The release of [[How to Destroy Angels (Remixes and Re-Recordings)|the *How To Destroy Angels* remix album]] and end of communication about the project shortly after may suggest that the former grew out of the work on *The Gate*.

## *Keep This Frequency Queer*

Evolving from Coil’s collaborations with William S. Burroughs in the mid-nineties, the two parties planned to collaborate on a “queer disco album”.[^9] The project was only publicly referenced twice, and not much more is known about it.

## *Intercourse* Series

A series of collaborative releases announced in January 1997.[^10] Two volumes were announced at this time, which would be collaborations with Autechre and Labradford, respectively. No further information was revealed beyond this initial announcement.

## Scatology \/ Horse Rotorvator Box Set

After the release of the 2001 remasters of [[Scatology]] and [[Horse Rotorvator]] and [[Love’s Secret Domain]], Coil intended to release a box set that would collect all three releases. Originally, it was intended to be simply a bundle of the three albums; later, it was announced that it would contain an exclusive remix of [[Panic]] on a 12” vinyl record, created by a yet-unannounced band; finally, the collection was set to feature a number of remixes from bands including Autechre, Surgeon, and Lefthandpath.[^11] After the set missed its projected release of late 2002, no further updates were given.

## *Wounded Galaxies Tap at the Windows*

*This section is currently empty, but is already planned to be filled out in the future. Feel free to leave any suggestions in the lobby!*

## *Telesmatic Tree in the King Scale*

The final studio album worked on by both [[Peter Christopherson]] and [[Jhonn Balance|John Balance]], *Telesmatic Tree in the King’s Scale* was announced in a news post on Coil’s Brainwashed site on April 24th, 2004, alongside [[The Ape of Naples]].The album was supposed to be available for purchase at the following shows (i.e. [[2004-05-23 — La Loco, Paris, France]], [[2004-05-31 — Wave Gothik Treffen 2004]], and [[2004-06-03 — Melkweg, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]), but this did not happen.[^12] The song “*[[Stranded With Gifts]]*”, played during Coil’s [[2004-10-23 — Dublin Electronic Arts Festival|final live performance]], was apparently due to be featured on the album, but nothing more is known about the fate of the project.[^13]
