# Unreleased Projects

Over the span of their career, Coil announced a number of projects that would not see release:

## *Force And Form*

An album mentioned as being in production towards the end of work on *[[Scatology]]*. It is not known if this evolved into some other project, and it was only mentioned once. [^1]

## *Live At Bar Maldoror*

Originally announced in 1985,[^2] *Live at Bar Maldoror* was intended to be a live video album. It was intended to be the third in a series of eponymous 1985 albums by *[[Steven Stapleton|Nurse With Wound]]* and [[People/David Tibet|[Current 93]]].[^3] It was mentioned again in the *Coil Info Booklet ＃2* in 1987 and during interviews in 1991 and 1992, the latter of which described it as having not been started.[^4]

The project was also referenced in the liner notes to *“[[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)|Gold is the Metal]]”*, where [[Thump]], [[For Us They Will]] and [[Soundtrap]] were described as having been “*Recorded live at Bar Maldoror*”. No official explanation for this has ever been given.[^5]

%% The “Bar Maldoror” concept was apparently something jointly invented by John Balance, Steven Stapleton, and David Tibet; the idea being that they would declare whatever venue they were playing at as “Bar Maldoror” to call back to this sort of shared context and atmosphere. There is a page on Discogs for it, (<https://www.discogs.com/de/label/323656-Bar-Maldoror?sort=year&sort_order=asc>) which is where I’m taking this info from, but I haven’t bought the magazine the quote’s from yet. It’s Issue #28 of Audion, if anybody else’s interested, its available here: <<https://audion1.bandcamp.com/album/audion-28-multimedia>%%>
