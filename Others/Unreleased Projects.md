# Unreleased Projects

Over the span of their career, Coil announced a number of projects that would not see release:

## *Force And Form*

An album mentioned as being in production towards the end of work on *[[Scatology]]*. It is not known if this evolved into some other project, and it was only mentioned once. [^1]

## *Live At Bar Maldoror*

Originally announced in 1985,[^2] *Live at Bar Maldoror* was intended to be a live video album. It was intended to be the third in a series of eponymous 1985 albums by *[[Steven Stapleton|Nurse With Wound]]* and [[People/David Tibet|[Current 93]]].[^3] It was mentioned again in the *Coil Info Booklet ï¼ƒ2* in 1987 and during interviews in 1991 and 1992, the latter of which described it as having not been started.[^4]
