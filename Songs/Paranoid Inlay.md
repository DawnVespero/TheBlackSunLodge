## Lyrics

> Serenity is a problem when you get this close to heaven  
> But you really want to see the wonders of the underworld  
> I caught St. Peter’s disease as he rattled his keys.  
> Serenity is a problem…
>
> Such a paranoid inlay  
> Hand-painted, pain-by-numbers, just join the dots  
> Serenity is a problem…
>
> Bloody British bulldozers  
> These vegetables are suicidal  
> It seems concussion suits you…
>
> Dear diary: I must take risks  
> I must not be afraid of failure  
> What do I need to give up?  
> Crystalline ladders, shiny things, mirror balls
>
> On a clear day, I can see forever that the underworld is my oyster
