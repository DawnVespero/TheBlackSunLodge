## Lyrics

> It’s either ether or the other  
> My mind is ???  
> Absenters absent  
> I’ve slipped the cup  
> I’ve taken a sip from the cup that slips into ether
>
> It’s either ether or the other  
> I press my window to the glass  
> The glass turns to gas  
> I breathe out ether  
> A glass of ether  
> Ether is a thief  
> It’s stolen my belief
>
> Slip through the ether  
> We both slip through the ether  
> Slipstreams of memory slipping away  
> This ether  
> ???…  
> Slip through the ether  
> Sip the ether…
>
> Slipstreams of memories slipping away…  
> Memories of Etruria, slipping away  
> Into ether..
>
> I’ve changed my mind, it’s what it’s there for…  
> Forever  
> Full of ether…
>
> I’m going upstairs now to turn my mind off…  
> To turn my mind off…
