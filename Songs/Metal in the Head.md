*__Metal in the Head__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]].  
From the liner notes:

> A psychotropic broadcast via Tesla’s wireless. The title is based on the fact that [Shostakovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich) composed music he claimed to hear in his head, receiving it like a radio broadcast. He had splinters of shrapnel lodged in his head from the First World War, which he believed were responsible for this transmission.[^ShostShrapnel] [^1]
