## Lyrics

> And who by fire?  
> Who by water?  
> Who in the sunshine?  
> Who in the night time?  
> Who by high ordeal?  
> Who by common trial?  
> Who in your merry merry month of May?  
> Who by very slow decay?
> 
> And who shall I say is calling?
> 
> And who in her lonely sleep?  
> Who by barbiturates?  
> Who in these realms of love?  
> Who by something *blurred*?  
> Who by avalanche?  
> Who by powder?  
> Who for his greed?  
> And who for his hunger?
> 
> And who shall I say is calling?
> 
> And who by brave ascent?  
> Who by accident?  
> Who in solitude?  
> And who in this mirror?  
> Who by his ladyâ€™s command?  
> Who by his own hand?  
> Who in mortal chains?  
> Who in power?
> 
> And who shall I say is calling?
