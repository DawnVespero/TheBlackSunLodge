*__Christmas Is Now Drawing Near__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 single “*[[Releases/Winter Solstice|Winter Solstice]]*”.

## Lyrics

> Christmas is now drawing near at hand  
> Come serve the lord and be at his command  
> And God a portion for you will provide  
> And give a blessing to your soul besides
>
> Down in the garden, where flowers grow in ranks  
> Down on your bended knee and give the lord thanks  
> Down on your knees and pray both night and day  
> Leave off your sins and live upright, I pray
>
> So proud and lofty is some sort of sin  
> Which many take delight and pleasure in  
> Whose conversation God doth much dislike  
> And yet he shakes his sword before he strikes
>
> So proud and lofty do some people go  
> Dressing themselves like players in the show  
> They patch and paint and dress with idle stuff  
> As if God had not made them fine enough
>
> Even little children learn to curse and swear  
> And can’t rehearse one word of godly prayer  
> Oh, teach them better, teach them to rely  
> On Christ, the sinner’s friend who reigns on high
