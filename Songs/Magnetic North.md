## Lyrics

> Heaviness…  
> Lucifer, six-pointed star…  
> Deep ruby red, inverted pyramid…  
> A red rose filling the skull…  
> Yellow cube in the lower pelvis  
> Yellow cube…  
> Silver moon crescent, below the navel  
> Red ruby inverted pyramid  
> White-winged bird behind the forehead  
> White-winged globe defines the forehead  
> Between the eyes  
> Between their eyes  
> Black oval egg occupying the throat  
> Black egg within the throat  
> A red rose filling the skull…
>
> Heaviness…  
> Lucifer, six-pointed star  
> Deep ruby red, inverted pyramid…  
> A red rose filling the skull…  
> Yellow cube in the lower pelvis  
> Yellow cube  
> Silver moon crescent, below the navel  
> Red ruby inverted pyramid  
> White-winged bird behind the forehead  
> White-winged globe defines the forehead  
> Between the eyes  
> Between their eyes  
> Black oval egg occupying the throat  
> Black egg within the throat  
> A red rose filling the skull…
>
> Heaviness…
