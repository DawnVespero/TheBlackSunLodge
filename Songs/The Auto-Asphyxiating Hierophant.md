## Lyrics

> Concentration and disasters  
> Our words not properly fixed  
> We‘ll fall or fixate  
> Is this the threshold?…  
> Fifty-seven-thousand poisons blended and descended  
> Indestructible and infinite dust  
> ??? zero charges electricity  
> In love with the sin of resistance  
> No action without, it seems, inaction  
> Making noise to cope with this pain  
> I happen to be in contempt of laws far more awful  
> It is logical, but fatal  
> Once more, the fortress of pure numbers  
> In confusion with the false moon  
> It will fall soon…  
> The white magick of the moon is the black magick of the earth  
> Spiders in webs on my nerves  
> To what extent do we exceed ourselves as to the damage?  
> You are misled and mistaken by instinct  
> I see temples crackle like capital in the rain  
> My eyes vibrate at a cat-nut rate  
> Stagger into the streets bearing aloft the blood red number  
> The flag, the banner  
> Stutter and stammer  
> Nothing will ever be the same…
