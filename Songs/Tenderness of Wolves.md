*__Tenderness of Wolves__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> *TENDERNESS OF WOLVES — Concerning species of Vampire: the physical, the insidious personal and the metaphysical. Backing track composed on the Fairlight. Alex Fergusson added acoustic guitar, and the vocal was written and performed by Gavin Friday. “For instance, there are honeyguides who, like cuckoos, lay their eggs in the nests of other species. The baby honeyguide is equipped with a sharp, hooked beak. As soon as he hatches out, while he is still blind, naked and otherwise helpless, he scythes and slashes his foster brothers and sisters to death…” Quote from “[The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)” Oxford University Press 1976. “The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness” From “[Beyond Good and Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_and_Evil)” Nietzsche* [^1]

The song is likely inspired by [the eponymous movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tenderness_of_Wolves_(film)) produced in West Germany in 1973. The film adapts the story of homosexual serial killer [Fritz Haarmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Haarmann), who, in the late 1910’s and early 1920’s, killed nearly 30 boys and young men in the German city of Hanover. During the murder, he often bit his victims’ throat, sometimes to the point of puncturing it, which gave him the nickname of the *Vampire of Hanover*. [^2]

## Lyrics

> Was all in vain? Or did you cry?  
> No need to ask, my tears have run dry  
> This is the end of my pity  
> I await to die
> 
> You now the living, me now the dead
> 
> To prove that you loved me  
> Mere words could not have said  
> Biting into skin, into flesh, into me  
> Taking all you could  
> Oh, I’d still give you blood  
> Just to paint your lips  
> If you should wish them red  
> My desires your kiss completed  
> But only now I can see  
> The vicious joy when you took delight  
> Behind each kiss your poison bite  
> And when my all was given  
> And you had taken  
> Oh dog-like Judas  
> You did disappear
> 
> Was all in vain? Or did you cry?  
> No need to ask  
> You now the living, me now the dead [^3]
