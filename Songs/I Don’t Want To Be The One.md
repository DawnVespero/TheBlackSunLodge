## Lyrics

> I don’t want to be the one, when everyone is gone  
> When everyone is gone
>
> I don’t want to be the one to play this dangerous game  
> To find out why they came
>
> I don’t want to be the one to open up this wound, to put my head inside  
> To find out you’re alive, to find out you are gone  
> I don’t want to be the one…
