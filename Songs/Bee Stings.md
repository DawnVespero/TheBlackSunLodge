## Lyrics

> Do you believe A.E.?  
> See for yourself the summer fields  
> See for yourself the summer fields  
> Before the tractor comes and wakes you  
> Before the cereal is sown  
> Walk along on your own  
> Don’t believe the guide books  
> See the glimmer on the wet stone surface  
> Be an idiot, be yourself  
> Drink the dew, drink the dew
