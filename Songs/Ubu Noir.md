*__Ubu Noir__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> *UBU NOIR - the Black King. Four sounds, sampled and sequenced on a Fairlight CMI. The title is a transmutation of* “[Ubu Roi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubu_Roi)”*, an Absurdist play by Alfred Jarry (1873–1907) “…(Not finding the suitcase, he takes his conscience by the feet, opens the door of the lavatory recess at the end of the room, and shoves him head first down the drain.)”* [^1]
