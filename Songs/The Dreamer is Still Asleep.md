*__The Dreamer is Still Asleep__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 1]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*Dense lyrics written from where I sleep, looking out to see/sea. Rural musings. See “Dream Photography”. It’s partly about William Blake and Samuel Palmer. Visionary ruralists. Also I lucid dream a lot and it’s about the layers of reality, awake and asleep, and how the two feed into each other.*”
