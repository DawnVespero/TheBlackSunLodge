*__The Dreamer is Still Asleep__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*Dense lyrics written from where I sleep, looking out to see/sea. Rural musings. See “Dream Photography”. It’s partly about William Blake and Samuel Palmer. Visionary ruralists. Also I lucid dream a lot and it’s about the layers of reality, awake and asleep, and how the two feed into each other.*”

## Lyrics

> Hush  
> May I ask you all for silence?  
> The dreamer is still asleep  
> May the goddess keep us from single vision and Newton‘s sleep  
> The dreamer is still asleep…  
> He‘s inventing landscapes and their magnetic fields  
> Working out a means of escape  
> We‘ll cut across the crop circles  
> The seer says „No, not much time left for these escape attempts“  
> Look at it this way: In ten years‘ time, who‘ll care?  
> Who‘ll even remember?  
> One dies like that: deep within it  
> Almost inside it  
> It‘s there for a reason  
> I‘ll give you my old dress and take that little book to tear and cut the paper  
> The beginning is also the end  
> Time defines it…  
> It will end like close friendship  
> Nothing could be further  
> We forget, the space between people and things is empty  
> We forget and don‘t notice the loss  
> Rushing into venerable degeneration  
> Such radiant pollution  
> The god with the silver hand surveys the vast and tender nations
>
> The dreamer is still dreaming…  
> In the heart of your heart your I remains  
> Is that hurt you?  
> Is that pissstain you call ??? ?  
> Your whole life is a cold, slow, sharp—…  
> Take all your time  
> Track the shabby shadow down  
> The pissy mists of history  
> The dreamer is still dreaming…
>
> Hush  
> May I ask you all for silence?  
> Will he wake in time to catch the sunset?  
> Hush  
> May I ask you all for silent—…
