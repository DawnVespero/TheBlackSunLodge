*__The Sea Priestess__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Releases/Astral Disaster|Astral Disaster]].

## Lyrics

> On the sea-coast of tibet, Egyptian Aztecs, arriving from Norway, have been branching the woodwork for forty-four centuries  
> Nature is naked  
> Acrobats bathed in blood  
> There’s a beast of prey on the threshold of pleasure there, and a giantess sea priestess beckoning the passers-by, “Do not loose sight of the sea.”
>
> After washing myself in a bath of blood, I had breakfast with the sea priestess  
> Her sibilant esses are escaping gas from the sea floor  
> The sea priestess lays on a bed of nails, twenty-f— saddled soldiers at her head  
> The sea priestess is escaping gas  
> The grass grows, is turned to gas, gas fired from a gun  
> Herbal hydrogen  
> If it goes any faster, there will be an astral disaster…  
>
> We spent most of the time pissing tiny diamonds  
> Passing the time, wondering whether we should walk down the same path that had introduced us to the valley the day before  
> I was woken three times in the night and asked to watch whales listening for earthquakes at sea  
> I’ve never seen such a strange sight before  
> Somehow, I think the soft verges of insanity and the hard shoulders of reality point past signs here  
> It’s probably a lack of poorer visibility  
> Something special in the esses that the rocks and the sea-shore make  
> ??? been desiccated like mummies  
> Been out in the sun for thousands of years, walking along  
> The women stuff themselves with collagen and other animal remains  
> I don’t think we’ll stay here long
>
> Soon as the ships have been rebuilt, we’ll be out of here, to the sun  
> Our ship was wrecked on the sea-coast of Tibet  
> The first thing we saw was several Egyptian Aztecs arriving from Norway  
> ??? all nature is naked  
> We watched acrobats bathing themselves in blood  
> Over the archway, there’s a beast of prey on the threshold of pleasure, and a giantess sea priestess beckoning the passers-by  
> She???, “Do not loose sight of the sea”  
> She hisses, “Do not loose sight of the sea”
