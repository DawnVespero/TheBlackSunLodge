*__Red Birds Will Fly Out of the East and Destroy Paris in a Night__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*This is 90% Thighpaulsandra’s, made to order from a brief from me. The title refers to a prophecy by Nostradamus that this will happen (in July this year - I reckon about the 18th). Is it literal or symbolic? I’m certainly not going there this Month. Red Bird…soviet planes…flamingos? It is a SH101 and modular synth called a Fenix, mostly. With overdubs of vocals by Balance.*”
