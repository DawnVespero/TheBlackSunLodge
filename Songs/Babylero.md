*__Babylero__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Horse Rotorvator]]. It is an interpolation of the chorus to the 1969 song *María Isabel* by the band *Los Payos* from Seville, Spain.[^1] [^2] The song is named for its singer Alan Babylero, a “12-year-old beach bum from Acapulco” whom the band payed to sing the song on record.[^3]
