*__Batwings (A Limnal Hymn)__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 2000 album [[Releases/Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 2|Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 2]].

## Lyrics

> *The key to joy is disobedience*  
> *There is no guilt and there is no shame*…  
> A moon-piece to fetch up the golden cup  
> A snow-piece to avoid the great heat of the sun is kept in the night and by the light of the moon  
> An ice-piece so as they seem forever falling  
> A night-piece of the dismal supper and strange entertainment  
> A rare-chance-piece, a handsome piece of deformity  
> The skin of a snake bred out of the spinal marrow of a man  
> With stones and illegible inscriptions found about great ruins  
> Pictures of three remarkable steeples or towers, built purposely awry, so as they seem eternally tipping and falling  
> A transcendent perfume made of the richest odorants, kept in a box of translucent scale  
> A glass of spirits made of ethereal salt, hermetically sealed up, kept continually in quicksilver of so volatile a nature that it will scarcely endure the light, and therefore only shown in winter or by the light of a carbuncle or a firefly  
> And bat wings…  
> And bat wings sing this limnal hymn  
> A whiteness, opening and closing  
> To keep the darkness sealed within…  
> A moon-piece to fetch up the golden cup
>
> *Basi du veduse*  
> *Base du vasule monati de ru verusei*  
> *Vasi leimon*  
> *Lihaliha…*  
> *These, these, these, un enu sabuleiumon*  
> *Balideseirai*  
> *Badivuse, vuse rune to seiumon*  
> *Basilabi basi shone, o lasila*  
> *Baleiumon, baleiumon soleia*  
> *Sileija hola*  
> *Baleiu veso durolea*  
> *Velese u varuse uno*  
> *Wa, wa deu seru varu paruse*  
> *Vasi delatera*  
> *Abi ha paleon*  
> *Ese leme to varesama*  
> *Ave useru lanuram*  
> *Laserama le solami deserei*  
> *Wilsi enada deuge…*

*Note: The final section of the song consists of indecipherable, non-lexical sounds. These were described by [[People/Peter Christopherson|Peter Christopherson]] at [[People/Jhonn Balance|Jhonn Balance]]’s funeral as “a language only he knows“.[^1] Balance himself also said that these are combinations of real words and improvised vocalisations[^2] The above transcription of this section is therefore only a best effort with no guarantees to accuracy.*
