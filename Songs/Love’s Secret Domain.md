## Lyrics

> Rose, thou art sick  
> Seduce, let loose the vision and the void  
> Blood sucklin’ honey suck  
> O Rose, thou art sick  
> Oh, the vision and the void  
> The blood sickle cuts the honey suck  
> O Rose, thous art sick
>
> In little children’s heavy heads  
> My dreams erupt while in my head  
> Innocence is, innocence is, innocence is dripping red  
> In dreams, I’ll walk with you  
> In dreams, I’ll talk with you  
> In dreams, you’re mine  
> All of the time
>
> Heads on fire and drunken lights  
> Days devoured by hungry nights
>
> In Love’s Secret Domain  
> This is mad love  
> This is mad love  
> In Love’s Secret Domain
>
> Sweet tortures fly on mystery wings  
> Pure evil is when flowers sing  
> My heart, my heart, my heart is a rose
>
> This is mad love  
> This is mad love  
> In Love’s Secret Domain
>
> Give sanity a longer leash  
> But some of us have sharper teeth  
> In dreams, in dreams, in Love’s Secret Domain  
> In dreams, I’ll walk with you  
> In dreams, I’ll talk with you  
> In dreams, in dreams, you’re mine all the time
>
> O rose thou art sick  
> The invisible one  
> The vision and the void  
> The blood sickle cuts  
> The honey sucks  
> O rose,  thou art sick
