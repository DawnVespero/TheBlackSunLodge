## Lyrics

> Where are you?  
> Are you hiding from me?  
> Are you still looking for things that no one else can see?  
>
> Where are you?  
> Are you in some place that we can not reach?  
> Are you bathing in moonlight or drowned on the beach?  
>
> Where are you?  
> Are you surrounded by thing we can not penetrate?  
> Is the cage you love the home you also hate?  
>
> Your fear of death attracts such strange objects  
> Smothering you, hiding you  
> Don’t let it spoil you  
> Show yourself, so the others may see you  
> So the others may feed you  
> They want to be near you  
> If you can’t get enough of your hypnotic injunction  
> Then it’s time to put an end to this invalid function  
> Poor little ghost boy  
> Let me be your human toy  
>
> Where are you?  
> No one’s seen you for years  
> Have your wounds grown wings?  
> Are you feasting on fears?
>
> I can see your dark corona is eating into you  
> You’re surrounded by things we can not penetrate  
> Is the cage you love the home you also hate?  
> Life lies with the scissors inside her  
> The surgeon was a butcher  
> All of us are wounded  
> Anesthetized in A&E  
> Numbed by stuff we should not see  
> Each of us lies bleeding  
> Our rivers intermingling  
> Poor little ghost boy  
> Let me be your human toy
>
> I’ll wrap my last kiss in a bandage…
