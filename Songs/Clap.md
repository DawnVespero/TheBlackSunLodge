*__Clap__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> *CLAP — Both the action and [the affliction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonorrhea). “Inject [procain penicillin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procaine_benzylpenicillin#Medical> uses): 4.8 million units at one time. Put half the dose in each buttock. It is important to use procain penicillin and not crystalline penicillin. If you can get [probenecid](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probenecid#Medical> uses), give 1 gm, half an hour before you inject the penicillin. If you do not have penicillin (or if it does not seem to work), use [tetracycline](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline#Medical> uses). Start by taking 6 capsules of 250 mg at once, then take two 250 gm capsules, 4 times a day for 4 days. If tetracycline does not work either, try [streptomycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin).” From “Where There Is No Doctor”, The Hesperian Foundation 1977.  
> “The rhinoceros had learned of what was about to happen. Covered in sweat, it appeared puffing and blowing at the corner of Rue Castiglione. It did not even have the satisfaction of joining the fray. The character who was scanning the neighbourhood from the top of the column cocked his revolver, took careful aim, and pressed the trigger.” From Lautréamont’s “[Maldoror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Chants_de_Maldoror)” *[^1]
