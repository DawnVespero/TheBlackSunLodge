*__Sicktone (Version 1)__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Transparent]].

## Lyrics
> *Are you bothered?*
> 
> *Stop! Stop!*
> 
> *Leave me alone*  
> *Leave me alone*  
> *Leave me alone*
> 
> *Get it out, get it out, get it out*  
> *Get it out, get it out*  
> *No*
> 
> *Get it out of here*  
> *Get. It. Out.*  
> *I want tits out*
> 
> (…The manifestation of Nuit. The unveiling of the company of heaven. Every man and every woman is a star. Every number is infinite; there is no difference. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men! Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue! Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.)

The final lines are a recording of the chanted opening lines from Aleister Crowley’s *The Book of the Law*, presumably from a thelemic gnostic mass.[^GnosticMass]
