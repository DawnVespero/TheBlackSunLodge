*__Rosa Decidua__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1998 single “*[[Releases/Autumn Equinox — Amethyst Deceivers|Autumn Equinox — Amethyst Deceivers]]*”.

## Lyrics

> Rose, I hear your voice near to me
> I’ve put away the poison chalice for now and lie down amongst the flower beds
> Whichever stars we walk among, we both seek out the darkest red
> The wine was turned to blood again
> Without this blood, we’d both be dead
> I’ve wound myself tight into the hedgerows
> Let’s see which way the winter wind blows
> -
> *—these bloody tears, bloody tears*  
> *You are my shadow, my—*  
> *Wrap your arms around the sea—*  
> *Time has passed, nothing will—*

Several more layers of vocals from [[People/Rose McDowall|Rose McDowall]] are also audible on the song, but are difficult to decipher due to them being heavily distorted and layered over each other.
