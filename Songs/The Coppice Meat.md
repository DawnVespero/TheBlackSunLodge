## Lyrics

> The mother tongue  
> Semblance to waking  
> Semblance to moving  
> Semblance to being over with  
> The mother tongue, joining of the drum  
> Mutter to the dream gutter  
> The bar of light blinding us at the peak  
> We wait for it no longer  
> Such speech in search of the dead  
> Only one sound jumping up to thee  
> They have sent me in search of the dazzling dead  
> And their faces blurring into the mist behind the hill  
> Only one song  
> Crazed purpose  
> Enactment in the land
>
> What was granted on that first timeout over the shadows?  
> They were filling every crooked palace of my eyes’ holes that look and lunged  
> On that first walk out
>
> What was spoken first? Was that all of this?  
> Every least part must be supernaturally clear  
> Illumined on the eternal tables  
> A shift
>
> What was spoken on the first part about the fresh, the vivid, the hole in the vortex where worlds pierced ideas with an absolute embrace and allowed themselves to exist in beauty?
>
> What was spoken from moment to moment?  
> Revolving in a clear space, without confusion  
> And the doors opened  
> The entire map appeared, a Plan of the whole  
> Worlds appearing, crashing into perfection like unimaginable, powerful, and efficient weapons  
> Stars consume us with longing  
> Boulders reach for us like lovers  
> And we enter singing  
> We have gone nowhere
>
> What was seen with the thousand eyes of us at the brink of all?  
> Suns, glory of mists cleared from the entryways across the valley floor  
> And the keepers who wait at the gates of the Plan
>
> What was heard in a skeleton’s brief aria of obedience as its rainbowed bones paid homage?  
> Wing-tip to wing-tip, the ones of the fell doomed magnificent crowd in to catch with tender clasp my wisdom which never was  
> To transport it, with all due pomp, to a distant spot where it may revolve forever on its own delicate pivot  
> In a style to which it is accustomed  
> Safe from me until time is no more
>
> And every gate to the Plan  
> And every threshold of every gate  
> And every approach from the far places,  
> And every cloud that hovers above the Plan, desiring wind  
> And the gleaming sky
>
> Where will the cries of the ecstatic iron bird find us, now that we know and the shift has shown us?  
> And we are walking with ourselves into the shaking air, needing nothing  
> And all being has become as breath over the transfigured spaces  
> Into the house of the heart on that First Time  
> Into the plan, through the gate of the First Time  
> Throughout the land, I saw you, whom my heart had never hoped to see  
> And it was all fire as the first drops of rain fell, and the scent, sliding down the air of the million-one desires of the unnamed god, penetrated us, all empty of wisdom at last  
> The gate of entry has passed and night fell over the dissonant ranges, here where it all began  
> As the ground trembles, the wraiths of what was un-god, anything before, bestows itself prostrate before us, prepared for annihilation  
> Engraved on the ground where we walk is this warning:  
> “Everything is now destroyed, do not seek to be anything other than this.  
> You will be divested of every garment until none remain.  
> What was born must become whole by annihilation, by the gates of the First Time, by the glittering flight of arrows into all twilights of knowing, by the din of the waning light.”
>
> What was spoken, what was heard, what was seen, beyond the shift?
