*__How to Destroy Angels__* is a song originally released on Coil's [[Releases/How To Destroy Angels|1984 debut single of the same name]].

The song was recorded at the same time as the [[Scatology]] track [[The Sewage Worker’s Birthday Party]], which reuses samples from the former. Most noticeably, the sounds of clashing swords are found prominently in both songs.
