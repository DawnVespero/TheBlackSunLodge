*__The Dreamer is Still Asleep__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*Most personal track. It’s dedicated to the poet Jeremy Reed. My good friend who is writing a book on COIL, at leisure, over the next two years. He wrote “The Last Star”, an appreciation of Marc Almond on Creation Press. Sleazy on vocals. This is about greens and ancestor worship as revealed to me through spirit discourse with Austin Spare and my grandad (deceased).My lyrics. I always want Peter to sing on stuff. I like writing lyrics for him. Nb. the track we did for Ivan Pavlov’s recent EP. Ivan, what’s the details? Broccoli hold subatomic secrets in its structure. Maybe Man’s salvation. Cures you on the urge to sprout cancers, esp. bowels, etc. Eat as much organic broccoli as you can, people. We recommend it. The brassica family are all helpers of mankind. Be kind to your vegetables. Write to me if you want details of how to adopt and sponsor rare varieties of vegetables.*”

## Lyrics

> *Wise words from the departing:*  
> *“Eat your greens, especially broccoli.“*  
> *Remember to say „Thank You“ for all the things you haven‘t had*  
> *By working the soil, we cultivate the sky*  
> *We embrace the vegetable kingdom*  
> *The death of you father, the death of your mother*  
> *Is something you prepare for all your life, all their life…*
>
> Wise words from the departing:  
> “The death of the mother and the death of the father  
> is something you prepare for for all of their life, for all of your life.“
>
> Wise words from the departing:  
> „Eat you greens, especially broccoli.“  
> Wear sensible shoes  
> And always say „Thank You“  
> Especially for all the things you never had
>
> Wise words from the departing:  
> „By working the soil, we cultivate the sky and enter the vegetable kingdom of our own heaven.“  
> “By working the soil, we cultivate good manners, which is to say ‚Please‚ and ‚Thank You‘ especially for the things you never had.“
>
> Wise words from the departing:  
> „Eat you greens, especially broccoli.  
> And always say ‚Thank You‘  
> Especially for broccoli.“
