*__The Dreamer is Still Asleep__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*Most personal track. It’s dedicated to the poet Jeremy Reed. My good friend who is writing a book on COIL, at leisure, over the next two years. He wrote “The Last Star”, an appreciation of Marc Almond on Creation Press. Sleazy on vocals. This is about greens and ancestor worship as revealed to me through spirit discourse with Austin Spare and my grandad (deceased).My lyrics. I always want Peter to sing on stuff. I like writing lyrics for him. Nb. the track we did for Ivan Pavlov’s recent EP. Ivan, what’s the details? Broccoli hold subatomic secrets in its structure. Maybe Man’s salvation. Cures you on the urge to sprout cancers, esp. bowels, etc. Eat as much organic broccoli as you can, people. We recommend it. The brassica family are all helpers of mankind. Be kind to your vegetables. Write to me if you want details of how to adopt and sponsor rare varieties of vegetables.*”
