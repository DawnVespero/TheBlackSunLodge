*__A White Rainbow__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 single “*[[Releases/Winter Solstice|Winter Solstice]]*”.

## Lyrics

> A White Rainbow  
> *A roaring aura*  
> Under an unquiet skull  
> *A tremulous column of air*  
> Moon’s Milk spills from my unquiet skull and forms a White Rainbow  
> *A roaring aura, Aurora Borealis*  
> A White Rainbow  
> A Lunar Ascension, A Solar Declension  
> A tremulous column of air hanging there  
> The bleached beach  
> A psychosis  
> *Laughing like skeletons clattering at midday*  
> Feel the moon’s pull…  
> The moon’s milk spills from my unquiet skull  
> A White Rainbow  
> Inverted Vertigo  
> A psychosis  
> *Moon’s Milk spills*  
> And overhead  
> *Feel the moon’s pull*  
> Overheard  
> A tremulous column of air hanging there  
> *A White Rainbow*  
> *Laughing like skeletons clattering at midday*  
> And overhead, a White Rainbow  
> Under an unquiet skull…  
> Feel the moon’s pull  
> A White Rainbow
