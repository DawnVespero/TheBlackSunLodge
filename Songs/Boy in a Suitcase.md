*__Boy in a Suitcase__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]].  
From the liner notes:

> This particular relic dates from the time of the very early Coil sessions. Played on a rented Fairlight and recorded in our bedroom. It features a rare vocal appearance from [[Peter Christopherson|Sleazy]] and has the added involvement of [[Andrew Poppy]] on brass. At the same time, we recorded the beginnings of several other tracks like “[[Ergot]]” and “[[Silence & Secrecy]]” that have yet to see the light of day. The title comes from a chance remark overheard in the back of a Marrakesh taxi, and later confirmed by a series of forensic photographs. [^1]
