*__The Test__* is a #Compilation_Track by Coil originally released on the compilation album “*[Mutek 03](https://www.discogs.com/de/release/190047-Various-Mutek-03)*” to accompany Coil’s performance at that year’s [[2003-05-29 — Mutek Festival ‘03|Mutek Festival]] in Montreal.

The track was originally written during the sessions for #Backwards , with different versions appearing on both [[Swanyard]] and [[Backwards (Cold Spring) (New Orleans Unmastered Mix)|the Unmastered Mix of the 2015 release of “Backwards”]]. Its appearance on the latter suggests that, even though it was only officially released in 2003, the version released at that time already existed by 1997. A version was also used as the backing track for “[[The Hundred Thousand Dollar Altar]]” during the sessions for “[[Releases/International Dark Skies|International Dark Skies]]”; this version can be found on the Threshold Archives release “[[Releases/Heartworms|Heartworms]]”.

## Versions

- __[[The Test]]__: The only version of the song that was officially released. This version can be found both on the compilation album “*[Mutek 03](https://www.discogs.com/de/release/190047-Various-Mutek-03)*” and [[Backwards (Cold Spring) (New Orleans Unmastered Mix)|the Unmastered Mix of the 2015 release of “Backwards”]].
- __[[The Test (Early)]]__: Found on “[[Swanyard]]”. This version is notably sparser, completely lacking the prominent drum beat of the released version, and being reduced instead to a noisy, repetitive sample loop.
- __[[Nature is a Language ∕ The Test]]__:
