*__Tainted Love__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1985 single [[Panic ∕ Tainted Love]]. It is a cover of a song originally written by Ed Cobb and released by Gloria Jones in 1964.[^1]

Coil’s choice to cover the songs was likely inspired by the cover version released in 1981 by Soft Cell, whose lead singer, [[Marc Almond]], was a known associate of the band and would collaborate with them numerous times. Further strengthening this link, Coil also recorded a cover of the Soft Cell song *[[Meet Murder My Angel]]* , though it would not be released until the publication of the 2015 re-release of the [[Wrong Eye (T-ARCH)|Scope / Wrong Eye]].

## Lyrics

> Sometimes, I felt I had to  
> Run away, I had to  
> Get away  
> From the pain you drove into the heart of me  
> The love we share  
> Seemed to go Nowhere  
> And I lost my life  
> For I tossed and turned, I couldn’t sleep at night
> 
> Once, I ran to you  
> Now, I run from you  
> This tainted love you’ve given  
> I gave you all a boy could give you  
> Take my tears, and that’s not nearly all  
> Tainted love…
> 
> Now I know, I’ve got to  
> Run away, I’ve got to  
> Get away  
> You don’t really want any more from me  
> To make things right  
> You need someone to hold you tight  
> And you say, love is to pray  
> But I’m sorry, I don’t pray that way
> 
> Once, I ran to you  
> Now,  I run from you  
> This tainted love you’ve given  
> I gave you all a boy could give you  
> Take my tears, and that’s not nearly all  
> Tainted love…
> 
> Don’t touch me, please  
> I can not stand the way you tease  
> I love you though you hurt me so  
> Now I’m going to pack my thing and go  
> Tainted love…
> 
> Touch me, baby  
> Tainted love  
> Touch me with your  
> Tainted love…
