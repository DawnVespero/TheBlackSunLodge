*__Lorca Not Orca__* is a song originally released on the CD version of Coil’s 1991 album [[Love’s Secret Domain]]. The title of the song may be inspired by [Federico Garcia Lorca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Garc%C3%ADa_Lorca), an associate of Salvador Dali whom [[Jhonn Balance]] acknowledged in an interview.[^1]
