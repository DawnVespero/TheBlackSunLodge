*__Teenage Lightning__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1991 album [[Love’s Secret Domain]]. Along with [[Amethyst Deceivers]], it is one of the most frequently revisited songs in Coil’s catalog, having been reinterpreted twice on Coil’s studio albums.

The most frequently given explanation for the song’s title is that it describes “the energy given off when two teenagers are rubbed together,”[^1] implying that it’s about sexual tension and/or young love.
