*__Red Queen__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]]. As seen in [[Jhonn Balance]]’s notes, the song was written in 1993 about Balance’s former Psychic TV partner Genesis P-Orridge.[^1] The time of writing implies that this was more directly inspired by [false allegations of child abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_P-Orridge#Psychic_TV_and_Thee_Temple_Ov_Psychic_Youth) levelled against P-Orridge the year prior.

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*This is about the phenomena that I see in media-based people that if you say something three times then, like the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll’s books, it becomes true or perceived as true). The original source is lost in translation. I hate HIS-STORY. The lies on the page. In print. There is NO truth anywhere. See Charles Manson (again) for true vision reTRUTH. This was in the works when John Everall phoned up and it clicked nto this embittered, world-weary vocal take. We were discussing the appearance of the Giant Red Spiders that had been plaguing us both from out the corner of our eyes. A fact. And talking about where they might be originating. Arachnoid subspace? Lovecraftian dementia-dimensions? This is based on the experiences I have had with an old Royalty-fixated old Queen I once new. Viva La Revoltion…revolution. Off with her head! She’s off her head anyway. Two red tracks, hmmmmm.*”
