*__Homage to Sewage__* is a song originally released on the 1984 compilation album *Life at the Top*. The song was intended as a sort of ‘concept sketch’ for the then-in-production [[Scatology]], attempting to lay out that album’s philosophical and musical identity.[^1] This is also apparent by the song’s similarly themed title.
