*__…Of Free Enterprise__* is a song originally released on Coil's 1987 album [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]]. The name of the song, along with [[Herald]] off [[Horse Rotorvator]], of which it is a remix, are a reference to the *[Herald of Free Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Herald_of_Free_Enterprise#Accident of 6 March 1987)*, a British passenger ferry that sank off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on March 6th, 1987.
