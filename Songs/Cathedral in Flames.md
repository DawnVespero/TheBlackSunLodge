*__Cathedral in Flames__* (known during development as *Salò*[^1]) is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> CATHEDRAL IN FLAMES. The Marquis de Sad, on a package holiday to Morocco, has a vision… Extracts from “The Times” July 10th 1984:  
> *“Night sky lit up by gothic glory ablaze”* “…when someone claims for their position, a divine intervention, I am always very cautious, and think that people should be very cautious about such claims” Archbishop of Canterbury… Witnesses reported that an electrical storm over York had produced flashes of lightning which had appeared to play about the roof of the Minster.  
> *“The Lord was on our side as we battled the flames”*  
> Then I laid my own beneath the heavy razor and the headsman made ready to accomplish his duty. Thrice the blade, with renewed vigour, sliced down between its slots. Thrice my physical body  -  especially at the base of the neck  -  was shaken to its foundations. [^2]

The track was likely inspired in part by a fire in the roof of the [Minster Cathedral ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Minster#1984> Fire)in York on July 9th, 1984, with the liner notes even quoting some of the newspaper coverage of the event.[^3]

## Lyrics

> Circle within Circle  
> And when that hour came  
> From words they passed to deeds  
> Spires, Spirals and Stones rise  
> “And in the distance  
> A cathedral in flames”
>
> Given a chance to recover his breath  
> And exposed  
> To the process once more  
> The youth squirmed  
> In a shower of gold  
> That etched on his skin the words:  
> ‘Paradise stands  
> In the shadow of Swords’ [^4]
