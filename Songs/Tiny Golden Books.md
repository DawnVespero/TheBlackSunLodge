## Lyrics

> Sun and Moon…
>
> Dark they were, with golden eyes  
> Brought golden books from darkened skies  
> Every word from every world within was written down  
> They read it all out loud to us with silver tongues of fire  
> That licked the sun and stars and moon, all space became a choir  
> Shining, shining, shining, then they left without a sound  
> Then they left without a sound, then they left without a sound
