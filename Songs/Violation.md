## Lyrics

> *Fear holds me here*  
*Watching, waiting, watching*
>

*Your eye… Wolf-eye, I…*  
*I teach you*  
*I hate you*  
*You’re waiting to be my sweetheart*  
*…holds me here waiting…*  
*Power danger violence fear*  
*The power, danger, violence, fear, fear*  
*Pain, and the pain*  
*Hurts when you fuck me…*  
*Hot hard prick rammed down my throat*  
*He only does it for my red-hot womb*  
*I’d give anything to leave now… Intimate*

>

*Power danger violence fear [repeated]*

>

*Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear…*  
*He only does it… He only does it …*  
*To leave me here, leave me here alone*  
*Lonely, touched (touched)…*  
*Till the flesh is cold red…*  
*Power, the power…*  
*Power danger violence fear*

>

*I do not fuck around, I never fucked in my life…*  
*Leave me here, leave me here, leave me, leave me*  
*Oh wolf, wolf-eyes*  
*I teach you,*  
*I hate you*  
*I kill you*  
*I…*

> [Screaming]
