*__The Wheel__* is a song originally released on the 1985 compilation album *If You Can’t Please Yourself, You Can’t Please Your Soul*. Intended as Coil’s first song, to be released in 1983, delays caused by [[Some Bizzare Records]]‘ Stevø Pearce meant the song would not see release until two years later.[^1]
