*__Titan Arch__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1991 album [[Releases/Love’s Secret Domain|Love’s Secret Domain]].

## Lyrics

> Crown the dark animal  
> Black jackal crawling  
> Eternal Returning  
> An end to the waiting
>
> There are thrones underground and monarchs upon them  
> They walk serene in spaces between
>
> At the head of the storm, darkness is rising  
> In the garden of jaws, his wounds are shining
>
> Angels take poisons in rotting pavilions  
> Under shivering stars, sickness is gilding
