*__A.Y.O.R__* is a song created during the #Backwards sessions and first released on the 2001 compilation album [[A Guide For Finishers — A Golden Hair|A Guide for Finishers: A Golden Hair]].

The name of the song — an abbreviation for *“At You Own Risk”* — is a twofold reference: Firstly, it is a slang term from the 1980’s gay scene for a particularly dangerous cruising spot. Secondly, it is a reference to the 1992 book *‘At Your Own Risk: A Saint’s Testament’*, written by frequent Coil collaborator [[Derek Jarman]].[^1]
