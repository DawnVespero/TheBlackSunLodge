## Lyrics

> *And I believe it was truth…*
>

*The truth has not been in your courtroom,*  
*Never has been in your courtroom.*  
*All you have is confusion in your courtroom.*  
*Why do I have to stand and take the blame for your sins again?*  
*I’ve spent my life in jail, paying for you, so that you could ride your bicycle, have*  
*your birthday parties, have what you call a life.*  
*You know, I never had a life. I don’t even know what life is, you know: I go to the*  
*desert, I’m not even allowed to live in your desert. I’m no good for anything except*  
*to be used, as your scapegoat.*

>

*I’m used. Every day of my life, I’ve been used. When I haven’t been used, and I have*  
*been on the — on the street – I’ve been chased, robbed, harassed, pushed, kicked,*  
*my ribs have been broken.*  
*You know, the same man that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks*  
*my brains out.*  
*He figures just because he’s the man (those scum) … nobody’s gonna say anything.*

>

*My daddy’s not a congressman, a doctor, or a lawyer.*

>

*..Under the door… Sneaking … Sneaking everywhere. Everything is sneaky up*  
*around Sneakyville…*  
*Has to be sneaky, and it’s even a shame to sneak… to make… Such an evil, nasty*  
*thing.*  
*You gotta sneak to get to the truth; the truth is condemned… The truth has been in*  
*your reservation, building your railroads, emptying your garbage. The truth is in*  
*your brains and your jails, and the young lads starting your courts or your congress*  
*where the old sit judgement on the young. They don’t know about the young…*

>

*Look at the madness that goes on. You can’t prove anything that happened yesterday. Now is the only thing that’s real. You can try to prove that Columbus sailed on*  
*that ocean, but it’s not the same ocean: it’s a different ocean. It’s a different world.*

>

*Every day, every reality is a new reality.*  
*Every new reality is a – is a new horizon – a brand-new experience oblivion.*

>

*A friend of mine… He’s afraid of what he might have to do in order to save his*  
*reality, as I saved mine.*

>

*You can’t prove anything: there’s nothing to prove. Every man judges himself. He*  
*knows what he is. You know what he was. I know what I am. We all know who we*  
*are. Nobody can stand in judgement – like you’re standing in judgement. of a*  
*human body… But it doesn’t amount to anything.*

>

*What they’re doing is, they’re only persecuting themselves. They’re persecuting*  
*what they can’t stand to look at in themselves: the truth! They can’t stand to*  
*look at the truth in themselves so they persecute themselves.*

>

*They’re persecuting themselves every time they go on the freeway.*

>

*They hate themselves. Look at the signs. Stop, go, turn here, turn there, you can’t*  
*do this, you can’t do that, you can’t, you can’t, you can’t, this is illegal, that’s illegal,*  
*everything’s illegal.*

>

*The police used to watch over the people; now they’re watching the people. The*  
*president doesn’t represent the people; he could be on the roadside picking up his*  
*children but he isn’t. He’s in the White House sending them off to war.*  
*And you’re saying I have to pay for this again, and again and again;*  
*I’ve gotta pay for your sins. How many times have I gotta pay for your sins?*

>

*I’m getting tired.*  
*I’m getting tired.*

The monologue that makes up the majority of the song is a recording from an interview with Charles Manson.[^MansonInterview] Over this, [[Jhonn Balance]] shouts words that are unintelligible on any known recording. [^1]
