*__Are You Shivering?__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*A very old title finanally realised. The juddery vocal loop shaped the track. On MDMA we would ask if each other were shivering, as pure doses can make the teeth chatter and the eyesight vibrate.*”

## Lyrics

> Are you shivering?  
> Are you cold?  
> Are you bathed in silver or drowned in gold?  
> These streams of vitality, with filaments as fine as a spider‘s web, pour through your mouth  
> They pour through your mouth  
> A river of silver  
> A river of flowers  
> I lie down and shiver in your silver river  
> Out drips the last drop of this vital fluid  
> Our life has grown weary  
> The stars have grown old  
> Are you still shivering?  
> Are you still cold?  
> Are you loathsome tonight?  
> Does your madness shine bright?  
> Are you loathsome tonight?  
> In the oceans of the moon, swimming squid-like and squallid  
> The bright moon is a liquid  
> The dark earth is a solid  
> This is moon musick in the light of the moon
