*__Are You Shivering?__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark, Vol. 1]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:

> “*A very old title finanally realised. The juddery vocal loop shaped the track. On MDMA we would ask if each other were shivering, as pure doses can make the teeth chatter and the eyesight vibrate.*”
