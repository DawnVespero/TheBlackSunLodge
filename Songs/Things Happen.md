## Lyrics

> Kill the creator,  
> I sent them the bomb (…)
>
> Daddy, do you have a cigarette for me?  
> I think, maybe it’s getting late  
> Maybe time is running out  
> You know, I knew somebody once  
> Rifled through his drawers  
> I wasn’t that suspicious, but  
> You know, these things, they happen  
> But, *muñeca*, do you have a towel?  
> See those people gather round  
> Baby, do you have a light?  
> What’s it like in Ohio?  
> Baby
>
> What’d you want to call me, *muñeca*?  
> Honey, do you like my dress?  
> You know, I think the color pink suits my complexion  
> Or is it a reflection of the sky outside, you know?  
> Why’re those people crowding round  
> You know, I think your time is running out  
> What was your name anyway?
>
> No lipstick on his collar  
> But maybe it was blood  
> I don’t know to this day, dear  
> Do you have another, uhhh—  
> Did you light that cigarette for me?  
> Did you leave that on the side?  
> Do you have another cigarette for me?  
> You know, uhhh— well, I had somebody once  
> You know, we used to cook a lot  
> Do you like chillies in Ohio?
>
> *Munyeca. Yo te ciaro.  
> Yo te ciaro Ohio. Muy bonito.*
>
> Anyway—  
> Where did I leave my matches?  
> I though they were on the table there  
> By the way, did you—  
> Do you have some cash for me?  
> Because, you know, I have to get a cab somewhere after here.  
> You know, I don’t want to push you, but uhhh—  
> You know, I’ve got to go someplace  
> There’s something burning in the kitchen  
> Did I put the pepper in?  
> I d— oh, dear?
>
> You know I— You know— You can’t  
> (…)  
> It must be like that for you a little bit—  
> (…)  
> It’s a bit of a— commotion  
> (…)  
> Nice meeting you
>
> It’s not that— I have no regrets but—  
> I did feel a little bit bad, you know?  
> It’s kind of like—  
> You know what it’s like
