*__Absolute Elsewhere__* is a song originally released on Coil’s debut single [[Releases/How To Destroy Angels|How To Destroy Angels]].

## Versions

Several versions of the song are known to exist on different pressings of [[Releases/How To Destroy Angels|How To Destroy Angels]]. The intention was for the track to be silent or non-existent: This was achieved by leaving its side blank (i.e. without pressed grooves) on the third pressing of the original vinyl single, and by making it a silent, 1 second-long track on the later [[How to Destroy Angels (Remixes and Re-Recordings)]]. However, several variations of the single are known to exist which have different versions of this track:

- The first pressing had grooves which would only play back static (presumably grooves pressed blank without sound)
- The second pressing held what is described as “playable, multi-layered music”
- A version from an unknown date with a constant sine tone for ≈15 minutes
- A version from an unknown date with a number of separate locked grooves, each with a different sine tone [^1]
