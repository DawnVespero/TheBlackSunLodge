*__Blood From the Air__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Horse Rotorvator]].

## Lyrics

> A sleeping explorer, his wandering mind crossed over the border  
> A mind like a cemetery where the corpses are turning,  
> Where the bodies twist deep in the frozen grip of a dreamless sleep  
> Then the last comes up like a wreck from the depths  
> He hears night calling and has dreams of waking  
> Here in this brightness that burns like slow lightning  
> He sees words burnt in ice and reads  
> That the world is a wound in the body of Christ  
> Effects of the animal, animal sound effects  
> He says, “Death, he is my friend,  
> He’s promised me a quick end.  
> The world is in pain and should be put down,  
> And God is a sadist, and that, he knows it.”  
> The depths of the night sky reflect in his eye  
> He says, “Everything changes, and everyone dies.”  
> And the night slits her veins  
> And the darkness drains  
> And the void rumbles in like an underground train  
> Forever comes closer  
> The world is in pain  
> We all must be shown, we must realize  
> That everyone changes and everything dies [^1]
