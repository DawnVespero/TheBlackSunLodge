*__Cardinal Points__* (known during writing as *’Leon March’*[^1]) is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]].  
From the liner notes:

> The Arrangement of real strings is by [[Billy McGee]]. This is an outtake from “[[Horse Rotorvator]]”. We had planned to adapt this piece when we were working on [[The Unreleased Themes For Hellraiser|the film score for Clive Barker’s “Hellraiser” movie,]] but we pulled out of the project before work could be completed. A forthcoming album, “[[The Sound Of Musick|The Sound of Music]]”, a collection of our film work, will probably include a more developed version of this track. [^2]

## Lyrics

> *Instrumental*

Though the song as released is purely instrumental, there were lyrics written for it by [[Jhonn Balance]].[^1]
