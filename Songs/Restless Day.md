## Lyrics

> Each time I wake up  
> Each time, I say:  
> “A shifting, slow beginning,  
> another restless day”
> 
> Doubt and indecision  
> Push me on my way  
> The shifting, slow beginning  
> Another restless day
> 
> Supermarket, Sunday  
> Faces cold and gray  
> Got little milk or tea left  
> No energy to play  
> Fear is the dagger  
> that locks my love away  
> The boy on the checkout says:  
> “Have a restless day”
> 
> Who has the nerve  
> To dream, create, and kill?  
> While it seems the whole moves  
> Everyone stands still  
> So there’s nothing, yes, there’s nothing  
> Everything makes me ill  
> While it seems the whole moves  
> Everyone stands still  
> Everyone stands still
> 
> Watching television in the afternoon  
> Wasting my life away  
> All they want to show me is  
> What’s under the clock today  
> But even rats in a cage  
> Are liable to stray
