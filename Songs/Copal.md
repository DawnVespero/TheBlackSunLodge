## Lyrics

> Looking upon it with a sense of dread  
> Facing it with a sense of dread  
> Gazing upon it with a sense of dread  
> Looking upon it with a sense of dread  
> Facing it with a sense of dread
>
> Larks, carrion crows, ortolans, turkeys, peacocks, guinea fowl, robin red breast, thrushes  
> Edible birds uttering horrible cries  
> Nocturnal birds, boiled owls…  
> Edible birds uttering horrible cries  
> Could you even swallow a boiled owl?…
>
> Looking upon it with a sense of dread  
> Gazing upon it with a sense of dread  
> Looking right upon it with a sense of dread
