# Teenage Lightning (10th Birthday Version)

*__Teenage Lightning (10th Birthday Version)__* is the fifth track on Coil’s 2004 album [[Black Antlers]] and its [[Black Antlers (2006 Re-Release)|2006 re-release]]. It is a reinterpretation of the original [[Teenage Lightning]] from the 1991 album [[Love’s Secret Domain]].

A much sparser, more lumbering arrangement than the original, this version is dominated largely by acoustic guitar and oboe, as well as stuttering, “glitchy” samples for rhythm. Vocals are largely absent, though the original’s vocals are used among the aforementioned rhythmic sampling.
