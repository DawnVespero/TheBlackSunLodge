## Lyrics

> Mama, mama, mama
>
> What can you see?  
> The miraculous image of sound washed ashore?  
> Hurts me to see
>
> Murderous papa  
> Chocolate caca  
> Desolate mama
>
> You are urgent messages, Mama  
> Open your mouth and let the gold coins fall  
> It’s the sale of the century…
>
> Run, lady, run  
> We can feel the rain coming  
> We feel like babies in the brine…
>
> Mama, papa  
> Murderous chocolate  
> God saved me from drowning, and kicked me to death on the beach  
> What’s his is history, what’s missed is mystery
>
> And the miraculous image of sound washed ashore  
> Mama, what can you see…
