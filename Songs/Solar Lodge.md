*__Solar Lodge__* is a song originally released on Coil's 1984 album [[Scatology]].
From the liner notes:

> *SOLAR LODGE — Recorded live at the Bar Maldoror, September 3rd 1984. [[Peter Christopherson|PC]] programmed rhythms and samples, [[Stephen Thrower|Stephen E Thrower]] additional percussion and clarinet, [[Jhonn Balance|JB]] guitar, bass and vocals. “There has been a lot of talk about a bottomless pit. I found a hole in the desert that goes down to a river that runs North underground, and I call it a bottomless pit because where could a river be going North underground? You could even put a boat on it. So I covered it up and I hid it and I called it The Devil’s Hole and we all laugh and we joke about it. How many people could you hide down this hole?” From “Your Children” by Charles Manson. *
