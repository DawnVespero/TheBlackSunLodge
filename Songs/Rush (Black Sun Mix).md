_**Rush (Black Sun Mix)**_ is a remix of the song “Rush” by Depeche Mode created by Coil. Created around the time of the song’s original release in 1994, the remix would not see any official release until 2004.

## Background
“Rush” was originally planned to be released as a final single in support of Depeche Mode’s 1993 album _Songs of Faith and Devotion_. Various artists were commissioned by the band’s label, Mute Records, to provide remixes of the song for this single. Coil were among those selected, both due to them having already introduced themselves to the label for sample licensing as well as their appreciation for the album.[^1] However, the “Rush” single was ultimately cancelled, leaving Coil’s remix unreleased.[^2]

The song reemerged as part of Coil’s [[Others/Song of the Week|Song of the Week]] series in 1997/1998. Consequently, it would appear on the [[Releases/Black Gold|Black Gold]] bootleg, which was a CD release of the _SotW_ tracks. Ultimately, it would see a very limited official release from Depeche Mode: a limited edition of their 2004 remix collection _Remixes 81···04_ contained a booklet with clues which could be used to unlock a special website containing 14 exclusive remixes, with the _Rush (Black Sun Mix)_ among them. Since both this secret site and the official Coil _SotW_ site went defunct after a few years, there has since been no official way to obtain this song[.  ](https://archive.org/download/CoilFlacDiscography/Also/Bootlegs%2C%20Demos%2C%20Unofficials%20etc/1998%20-%20Black%20Gold%20%28Songs%20of%20the%20Week%20%29/22.%20Rush%20%28Black%20Sun%20Remix%29.mp3)
