## Lyrics

> *Hello?*  
> *Running the track now.*  
> *Five, four, three, two, one—*
> 
> Follow the Black Valley trail of Death  
> *Ju–, Ju–, look at it this way—*  
> Into the beautiful sunshine  
> [???]  
> Learn to kill, kill from the inside  
> *Nah, you’re breaking up, you’re breaking up—*  
> *I’m having somebody else on the line, you gotta— hold your own [???]*  
> Penetralia, mercenary paraphernalia  
> *—sex, sex scenes, funeral music*  
> *Submissive and dominant—*  
> *With us— are you with us? Within us—*  
> *Caught between two cars about to crash—*  
> In the future, you’ll learn that survival depends on how little or how much you leave to chance  
> *What are you wearing under that?*  
> *Some– something’s coming out the [???], looks like, like sex scenes—*  
> *Monster car, monster entrails, pictures of [???] with women struggling to enter the recesses of my own body*  
> *I can— I can see classical horrors, this is going to take boundless bloody hours—*  
> *Words and pictures*  
> *Split-second face—*  
> *There’s some heavy calm blood on the doctor’s hands — That sledgehammer crashes with the killer-boy kisses—*  
> *Kiss, kiss to kill—*  
> *I can— I can see something in the car in front—*  
> *Five minutes, okay?*  
> *Killer-boy kisses*  
> The Diminishes returns— the Diminishing returns as [Hughie Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughie_Green) with a horse’s head—  
> *Hello, ergh— uh—*  
> [???]  
> *I k— I keep moving, and now I can’t stop—*  
> *Caught, I mean, caught between—*
