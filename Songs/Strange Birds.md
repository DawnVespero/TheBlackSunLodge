*__Strange Birds__* is a song originally released on Coil's 1999 album [[Musick To Play In The Dark]].

From the *Track-by-Track* feature:
>“*"One day your eggs will hatch and some very strange birds are going to emerge." Birds and their song fascinates me. I guessed they were dinosaurs when I was a kid. They've never fooled me. I once regressed to BIRD MIND and only squawked and chirruped for three worrying days. I was away with the birds. I found this quote somewhere. It could be from anywhere, as with my lyric on Backwards. Max Ernst's Loplop bird teacher makes more sense to me now. I used to be terrified that a bird's wing would slice open my eye.*”

## Lyrics
> One day, your eggs are going to hatch, and very strange birds are going to emerge…
