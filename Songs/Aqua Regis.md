*__Aqua Regis__* (known during development as *And Think Of England* and *[[Aqua Regalia]]*) is a song originally released on Coil’s 1985 single [[Panic ∕ Tainted Love]].

## Lyrics

> *Instrumental*

Though the song as released is purely instrumental, there were lyrics written for it by [[Jhonn Balance]]. A notable feature of these unused lyrics is an early use of the *’Funeral Music for Princess Diana’* title.[^1]
