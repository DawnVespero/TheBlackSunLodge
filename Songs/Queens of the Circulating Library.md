## Lyrics

> I am the queen of the circulating library
> I have declared an amnesty
> All books may be returned without a penalty
> Return the books to me
> Return the books, don’t burn the books
> You cut down the trees to make paper disease
> 
> It’s in the trees, it’s coming
> 
> Return the Book of Knowledge, return the Marble Index
> File under “Paradox”
> 
> The forest is a college, each tree a university
> I am the queen of the circulating library
> I’m here to answer your enquiry
> All knowledge resides within me
> 
> Your membership has expired
> You are way past expiry dates
> 
> Words, words, words
> You may as well listen to the birds
