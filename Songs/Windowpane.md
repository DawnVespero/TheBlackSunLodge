*__Windowpane__* is a song originally released on Coil’s [[Releases/Windowpane|1990 single]] of the same name.  
The name of the song is based on Windowpane LSD, a form of LSD baked into a small gelatin square.[^1] [^2]

## Lyrics

> In the sky and  
> In the eye and (…)  
> If you want to touch the sky  
> Just put a window in your eye  
> See the sun and  
> See the rain  
> See the window  
> See the pain
>
> See the sun and  
> See the rain  
> See the bird’s-eye  
> See the brain  
> Ancient cities rise again
>
> See microscopic  
> See world view  
> See the future leaking through  
> See the person who once was you
>
> See the sea-shore and  
> See the sand  
> See your windows in your hand  
> See the lie
>
> Gold is the sky in concentrate  
> Power in its purest state  
> Powers surge  
> Power will rise  
> Through the window and  
> Through the skies  
> Through the sky  
> See the sky and  
> See the eye and  
> See the sky and  
> In your hand, in the sky, and in your eye  
> See the sky  
> In your hand, in your palm  
> See the sky and understand
>
> Gold is the sky in concentrate  
> Power in its purest state  
> Power will rise  
> Power will fly  
> Through the window  
> Through your eye
>
> Gold is the sky (…)  
> Riches, treasures (…)
>
> Gold is the sky in concentrate  
> Power in its purest state  
> Power will rise  
> Power will fly  
> Through the window  
> Through your eye
>
> Gold is the sky—
