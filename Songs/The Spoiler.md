## Lyrics

> The Spoiler  
> follows you  
> In Spoiler’s time  
> from place to place  
> Old man’s eyes  
> In a young boy’s face  
> Walking in  
> Another’s skin  
> Secrets inside  
> The Spoiler  
> The Spoiler’s catch:  
> Boys who exist  
> In the stories of shadows  
> On our walls.  
> Who take to the floor  
> Like a falling wall  
> To dance  
> with oblivion  
> Black boxes  
> Black light  
> He works  
> At night  
> The Spoiler  
> If you’re going to have any  
> The Spoiler  
> You’ve got to have enough  
> His head  
> Resting  
> His hands  
> Continents  
> His feet  
> His heart  
> …Apart [^2]
