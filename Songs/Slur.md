## Lyrics

> Roman lands  
> Of Roman sands  
> And Roman sons
> 
> As I watch the sun sink down  
> On the blood-red edge of the blood-red town  
> There are shadows for sale  
> On the edge of town  
> At the edge of the night  
> Is a darkness seen from the side of the light  
> (From the side of the night)  
> And the wind blows ‘round this sleeping town  
> This sleeping town
> 
> This Roman land  
> Of Roman sands  
> And Roman sons
> 
> And it seems to me that when I close my eyes  
> All the lights in the world go out  
> And the night passes by  
> And you whisper to me a thousand lies  
> I stare in surprise  
> Towards the desert’s warm black  
> And the desert stirs  
> And the desert stares back  
> With a thousand eyes  
> Piercing eyes  
> Ancient eyes
> 
> And I ask my lover, “Do you know where the desert roses bloom and grow?”… [^1]
