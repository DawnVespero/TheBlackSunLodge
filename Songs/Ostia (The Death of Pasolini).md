## Lyrics

> There’s honey in the hollows  
> And the contours of the body  
> A sluggish golden river  
> A sickly golden trickle  
> A golden sticky trickle
> 
> You can hear the bones humming…  
> And the car reverses over the body in the basin  
> In the shallow sea-plain basin  
> And the car reverses over  
> And his body rolls over  
> Crushed from the shoulder
> 
> You can hear the bones humming  
> Singing like a puncture
> 
> Killed to keep the world turning…
> 
> Throw his bones over the white cliffs of Dover  
> Into the sea, the sea of Rome  
> And the blood-stained coast of Ostia  
> Leon like a lion  
> Sleeping in the sunshine  
> Lion lies down
> 
> “Out of the strong came forth sweetness”…
> 
> Throw his bones over the white cliffs of Dover  
> And murder me in Ostia  
> The sea of Rome
> 
> You can hear his bones humming  
> Throw his bones over the white cliffs of Dover  
> And into the sea, the sea of Rome  
> Then murder me in Ostia [^1]
