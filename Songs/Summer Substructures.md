## Lyrics

> We‘re going under…  
> By the water, river  
> We‘re sold aside  
> We‘re going so near  
> We are soul song  
> We are sold  
> We are soul  
> We are so low  
> We are soldiers of my soul
>
> On storms, the iron rowed  
> There‘s someone in my hole  
> Dreams are on the water  
> The light beats even faster than necessary  
> The roaring is in me  
> Coming to me
>
> Over the waves we go  
> Over the lazy haze we go  
> I lay by the water, on the water‘s edge  
> When I walk there, I know
