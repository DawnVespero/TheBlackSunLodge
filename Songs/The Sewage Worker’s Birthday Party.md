*__The Sewage Worker’s Birthday Party__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> *THE SEWAGE WORKER’S BIRTHDAY PARTY — Inspired by a story in the Swedish magazine Mr SM (no 24) not available in the UK though quite easily obtainable from sex-shops in the larger European cities. This track consists of samples made from private recordings and from our previous record “[[Songs/How to Destroy Angels|How to Destroy Angels]]”. With bass by [[Jhonn Balance|JB]]  
> Excerpt from “The Sewage-Worker’s Birthday Party”:  
> Steve had worked in a sewage plant on the outskirts of Scunthorpe for three months and today was his twenty-first birthday.  
> The squad was the filthiest of any sewage plants in the area. Not one of them washed his working clothes. They changed in a group of huts round a brick building which was supposed to be a toilet and washhouse. The wash-hand basins and the showers worked, but the urinal drain was blocked with the result the floor had a permanent pool of piss. The three lavatory bowls were blocked and had a mixture of shit and piss lying in them all the time. The wooden partitions separating the bowls into cubicles had been broken due to fighting and had been eventually removed leaving the bowls exposed for all to see.  
> On every guy’s birthday he received a special “Treat” from the squad. It would follow the usual pattern, tied to the lavatory bowl and used as a urinal for a couple of hours. What Steve didn’t know was that a lot of the guys were fed up with his arrogant ways and wanted to do something extra.  
> Just before lunch several guys grabbed Steve and took him to the toilets. The Celebrations were about to begin.* [^1]

The remainder of the story:

> *He was ordered to lie down in front of one lavatory and his wrists were tied round the back. This meant his cheek was hugging the side of the filthy bowl. A rope was tied round each of Steve’s Wellingtons keeping his feet well apart. Dave took a cloth, dipped it in the bowl with its mixture of shit and piss and suddenly rammed the cloth into Steve’s mouth. He was taken by surprise. This had never happened before.  
> John grabbed Steve’s hairs and quickly jerked his head to the side sufficiently to pull a shortrope round and tie the gag into place. It was impossible for him to move or say anything. He was completely at their mercy…* [^2]
