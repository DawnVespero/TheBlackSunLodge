*__Penetralia__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Horse Rotorvator]].

A handwritten lyric sheet for this song can be found in the booklet for the [[Live Coil Archive]]‘s [[Contaminated Apples： 1986-1991 Appendices]].[^1]

## Lyrics

The liner notes for the 1988 CD release to not give any lyrics for *Penetralia*, treating it as an instrumental track. In spite of this, various snippets of monologues can be heard during the song, which were written specifically for it:

> *Nah, you’re breaking up, you’re breaking up totally—*  
> Penetralia, mercenary paraphernalia  
> *—sex, sex scenes, funeral—*  
> Submissive and dominant  
> —with us?  
> Split-second face—  
> Kiss to kill—  
> The Diminishes returns— the Diminishing returns as—

The same vocal track can be heard more clearly and completely on the remix [[Penetralia II]].
