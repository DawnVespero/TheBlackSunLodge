*__Panic__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> *The original rhythm programmed by [[Peter Christopherson|PC]] with a large amount of additional sampling and arranging by [[J.G. Thirlwell|Clint Ruin]]. Guitar and vocals by [[Jhonn Balance|JB]]* “I summon little PAN; not dead” *We are great believers in the redeeming powers of Chaos and confusion. Out of the primal chaotic state came the order of the Universe, a mass of potential and creative energy. Those that have the Will and the Strength can form things out of this state. Panic is about the deliberate nurturing of states of mind usually regarded as dangerous and insane. Using fear as a key, as a spur, as a catalyst to crystallise and inspire. It is about performing surgery on yourself — psychic surgery — in order to restore the whole being, complete with the aspects that sanitised society attempts to wrench from your existence… A murder in Reverse.* “The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects”[^1]

## Lyrics

> “Anything  
> will be alright  
> if you come out  
> in the night”
> 
> With your life sewn open  
> Breath in  
> Put the bone back in  
> Buried under the skin
> 
> Murder in Reverse
> 
> Out of time  
> Out of place  
> Out of spite  
> Swallow the spike
> 
> The only thing to fear  
> Is fear itself… [^2]
