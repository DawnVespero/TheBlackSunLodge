*__Is Suicide A Solution?__* is a song originally released on Coil’s [[Airborne Bells ∕ Is Suicide A Solution]] with [[Airborne Bells]].

The song, an extended version of [[Who’ll Fall?]] from [[Stolen and Contaminated Songs]], was primarily inspired by the suicide of a friend of the band, who jumped from a window while listening to their music; the cover of the single uses a photograph taken from the same window that friend jumped from.[^1]

The song may be related to, or may have evolved from, a song the band wrote about the French Surrealist writer [René Crevel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Crevel);[^2] Crevel answered the question *“Suicide: Is it a solution?”*, posted in the Surrealist magazine *La révolution surréaliste* , positively and committed suicide a decade later.
