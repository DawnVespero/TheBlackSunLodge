# Silence & Secrecy

*__Silence & Secrecy__* is a song by Coil, only performed live once on [[1983-08-04 - “A Manifestation of the Will”|August 4th, 1983]]. An [[Silence & Secrecy (section) (live at Magenta Club, London 5.VIII.1983)|excerpt]] of this performance was released on the Coil/Zos Kia live album [[Transparent]].

Musically, it has been described by [[Jhonn Balance]] as a “*15 minute piece with amplified insect noises pushed to deafening pitch, with violins and various other tapes etc.*”

The song was originally intended to be released as Coil’s debut single, with [How to Destroy Angels](app://obsidian.md/Songs/How%20to%20Destroy%20Angels) originally created to serve as the B-side to this single. [^1] However, this single was also intended to be released through Psychic TV’s Temple Records; due to [Peter Christopherson](app://obsidian.md/Peter%20Christopherson) and [John Balance](app://obsidian.md/John%20Balance) leaving Psychic TV in 1984, the band were presumably no longer willing to release the single.[^1]
