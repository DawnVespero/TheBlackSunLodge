*__Herald__* is a song originally released on Coil's 1987 album [[Horse Rotorvator]]. The name of the song, along with its remix [[â€¦Of Free Enterprise]] from [[Gold is the Metal (with the Broadest Shoulders)]], are a reference to the *[Herald of Free Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Herald_of_Free_Enterprise#Accident of 6 March 1987)*, a British passenger ferry that sank off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on March 6th, 1987.
