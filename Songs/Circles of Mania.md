*__Circles of Mania__* is a song originally released on Coil’s 1987 album [[Horse Rotorvator]].  
The song went under the working title of *‘Twister’*, but this was changed to avoid similarities to the Psychic TV song *‘Twisted’*.[^1]

## Lyrics

> *Next on stage, children, here’s Joey—*
>
> Nero’s long hot tongue  
> Nero’s long hot tongue licks
>
> This is the sound of the world turning ‘round  
> The underground—  
> This is the sound of the world turning ‘round  
> The world spinning—
>
> You get eaten alive by the perfect lover…
>
> I fell into a burning ring  
> A burning ring of knives  
> And the knives slide in  
> They slide deep into my skin  
> And they open me so wide that you stick your head inside  
> You get sewn inside alive  
> You  get eaten alive…  
> You get eaten alive by the perfect lover…
>
> When you’ve swallowed one, you just swallow another…
>
> To drive away this hunger, you stay in there forever  
> Caught in the centre of a circle of mania  
> Chemical angel enters arena  
> Toro D’or falls to the floor  
> And he’s fucking the floor  
> Fucking the ground…  
> The hole in the ground…
>
> And hot wires sing deep in my skin  
> I’m writhing, perspiring  
> Like [Dutch Schultz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Schultz#Death) at 106 degrees…  
> I wake up licking and sucking the bedsheets  
> Licking and sucking… [^2]
