*__Godhead⇔Deathead__* (pronounced *“Godhead turns Deadhead”*) is a song originally released on Coil’s 1984 album [[Scatology]].  
From the liner notes:

> GODHEAD ⇔ DEATHHEAD. “In the beginning was the Word” Originally to be called “[[Ergot]]” after the hallucinogenic toxin Ergot Rye Mould, Claviceps purpurea, found growing parasitically on the grain that, when inadvertently baked into bread, was responsible for outbreaks of [St. Anthony’s Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergotism), mainly during the middle ages. The symptoms included seizures, religious visions (“… some see Heaven, some see Hell…”), and limbs that turned black, gangrenous and eventually dropped off. Ergot alkaloids provided the original source of LSD-25, subsequently [synthesised by Albert Hofmann in Switzerland in 1943](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_lysergic_acid_diethylamide#“Bicycle> Day”). “The word of Sin is Restriction”[^1]

## Lyrics

> Godhead turns Deathhead  
> Three in One, One in Three  
> The crutch of Christianity
> 
> This is not Paradise Lost  
> But Paradise Disowned
> 
> Virgin Mary, weak and wild  
> Rids herself of an unwanted child
> 
> Price of love, Pain to pay  
> For a quick visitation in the hay
> 
> A reign of love  
> That stank of death
> 
> Nowhere New Jerusalem  
> No Festival of Light  
> A moral mean majority  
> Who’d  
> “Kill a queer for Christ” [^2]
