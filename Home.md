# Welcome to the Black Sun Lodge

Welcome, astral traveller, to the cold, musky halls of __Thee Black Sun Lodge__! Our circulating library holds the internet’s comprehensive resource on the work of the British musical project [[Coil]]. Feel free to browse the shelf below for a selection of our most important articles. If you would like to suggest an addition to our shelves or simply feel in need of a rest among like-minded dead souls, take a seat in [our lobby](https://discord.gg/YRV7snQ7Ps) and savour the Discord before your next journey across the spiritual planes.
